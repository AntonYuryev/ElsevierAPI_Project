      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Status Epilepticus and Non-emergent Loading Dose: Adult loading dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 50 mg/min. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric loading dose is 15 to 20 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg/min, whichever is slower. ( 2.8 ) Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. ( 2.2 ) Maintenance Dosing: Initial loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection every 6 to 8 hours. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Intramuscular Administration: Because of erratic absorption and local toxicity, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should ordinarily not be given intramuscularly. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The addition of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. M onitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin in the management of status epilepticus and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin. If administration of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure : May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions : Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity : If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium\", \"psychosis\", or \"encephalopathy\", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see W arnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see Boxed Warning and Wa rnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Sk in and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Sp ec ial Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 1 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g.,*1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1 ). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] ."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. S e x /Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11 ). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1 % in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fe rtility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION W ithdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . P otential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic R eac tions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Manufactured by: Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is two phenytoin chewable tablets three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily; an increase to twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily may be made, if necessary. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING. Phenytoin chewable tablets can be either chewed thoroughly before being swallowed or swallowed whole. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is two 50 mg phenytoin chewable tablets by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). If the daily dosage cannot be divided equally, the larger dose should be given before retiring. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.6) ] . 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin chewable tablets dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin chewable tablets at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin chewable tablets. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) \u2022 Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin chewable tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin chewable tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see CONTRAINDICATIONS (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see OVERDOSAGE (10) ]. Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents (usually in combination) Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lacosamide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.5) ]."

Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin chewable tablets, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed phenytoin chewable tablets are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent serum levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination Clinical studies using phenytoin chewable tablets have shown an average plasma half-life of 14 hours with a range of 7 to 29 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin chewable tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and OVERDOSAGE (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS (8.1 , 8.2) ] .

Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. o All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of phenytoin chewable tablets. o If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking phenytoin chewable tablets. o Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking phenytoin chewable tablets, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. \u2022 Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take phenytoin chewable tablets while you are breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the levels of phenytoin in your blood. Taking phenytoin chewable tablets with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take phenytoin chewable tablets? \u2022 Take phenytoin chewable tablets exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. \u2022 Your healthcare provider will tell you how much phenytoin chewable tablets to take and when to take it. \u2022 Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed. Do not change your dose of phenytoin chewable tablets without talking to your healthcare provider. \u2022 If your healthcare provider has prescribed phenytoin oral suspension, ask your pharmacist for a medicine dropper or medicine cup to help you measure the correct amount of phenytoin. Do not use a household teaspoon. Ask your pharmacist for instructions on how to use the measuring device the right way. Do not stop taking phenytoin chewable tablets without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping phenytoin suddenly can cause serious problems. What should I avoid while taking phenytoin chewable tablets? \u2022 Do not drink alcohol while you take phenytoin chewable tablets without first talking to your healthcare provider. Drinking alcohol while taking phenytoin chewable tablets may change your blood levels of phenytoin which can cause serious problems.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL three times daily, with dose adjustments as necessary, up to 25 mL daily. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION ONLY; NOT FOR PARENTERAL USE A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL (125 mg/5 mL), or one teaspoonful, by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements, up to a maximum of 25 mL daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosages, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve phenytoin steady-state blood levels, and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and DILANTIN Infatabs. DILANTIN extended capsules and parenteral DILANTIN are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin oral suspension dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When in the judgment of the clinician the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin oral suspension as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents (usually in combination) Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lacosamide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] ."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin oral suspension, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Instruct patients to use an accurately calibrated measuring device when using this medication to ensure accurate dosing. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin oral suspension and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence.

( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION ONLY; NOT FOR PARENTERAL USE A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL (125 mg/5 mL), or one teaspoonful, by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements, up to a maximum of 25 mL daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. With recommended dosages, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve phenytoin steady-state blood levels, and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Phenytoin extended capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin oral suspension at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin oral suspension. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When in the judgment of the clinician the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin oral suspension as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ]. A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes ( 7.1 , 7.2 ). 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents (usually in combination) Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium, valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients ( 8.6 ). 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin oral suspension, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]."

Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ]. Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin oral suspension and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Status Epilepticus and Non-emergent Loading Dose: Adult loading dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 50 mg/min. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric loading dose is 15 to 20 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg/min, whichever is slower. ( 2.8 ) Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. ( 2.2 ) Maintenance Dosing: Initial loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection every 6 to 8 hours. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Intramuscular Administration: Because of erratic absorption and local toxicity, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should ordinarily not be given intramuscularly. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The addition of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. M onitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin in the management of status epilepticus and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin. If administration of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure : May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions : Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity : If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin.In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 orCYP2C9genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium\", \"psychosis\", or \"encephalopathy\", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see W arnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see Boxed Warning and Wa rnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Sk in and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Sp ec ial Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 1 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g.,*1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1 ). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] ."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. S e x /Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11 ). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1 % in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

S e x /Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10, 25, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fe rtility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION W ithdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . P otential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic R eac tions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Manufactured by: Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING ( 2.1 ) Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is two Infatabs three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be six to eight Infatabs daily; an increase to twelve Infatabs daily may be made, if necessary. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING. Phenytoin Infatabs can be either chewed thoroughly before being swallowed or swallowed whole. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is two 50 mg Infatabs by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of twelve Infatabs daily. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be six to eight Infatabs daily. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). If the daily dosage cannot be divided equally, the larger dose should be given before retiring. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in DILANTIN-125 (phenytoin) Suspension and Phenytoin Infatabs. DILANTIN (phenytoin sodium) extended capsules and parenteral DILANTIN (phenytoin sodium) are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Phenytoin Infatabs, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing Phenytoin Infatabs or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) /Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome . Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For Phenytoin Infatabs, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed Phenytoin Infatabs are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent serum levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg DILANTIN (phenytoin sodium) extended capsules. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination Clinical studies using Phenytoin Infatabs have shown an average plasma half-life of 14 hours with a range of 7 to 29 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy : It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2\u20133% in the White population, 0.5\u20134% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15\u201336% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including Phenytoin Infatabs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] .

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Phenytoin Infatabs, Chewable Tablets, USP This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Revised: 11/2020 What is the most important information I should know about phenytoin? Do not stop taking phenytoin without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping phenytoin suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Like other antiepileptic drugs, phenytoin may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Phenytoin can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat Sores in your mouth Bruise easily Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Nausea Vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking phenytoin for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. Phenytoin can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What is phenytoin? Phenytoin is a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take phenytoin if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in phenytoin. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in phenytoin. Have had an allergic reaction to CEREBYX (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. Take delavirdine. Before taking phenytoin, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to phenytoin called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones Have or had liver or kidney problems Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Phenytoin may harm your unborn baby. If you take phenytoin during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking phenytoin, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of phenytoin. If you take phenytoin during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of phenytoin. If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking phenytoin. Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking phenytoin, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take phenytoin while you are breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the levels of phenytoin in your blood. Taking phenytoin with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take phenytoin? Take phenytoin exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much phenytoin to take and when to take it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed. Do not change your dose of phenytoin without talking to your healthcare provider. If your healthcare provider has prescribed DILANTIN (phenytoin) oral suspension, ask your pharmacist for a medicine dropper or medicine cup to help you measure the correct amount of phenytoin. Do not use a household teaspoon. Ask your pharmacist for instructions on how to use the measuring device the right way. Do not stop taking phenytoin without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping phenytoin suddenly can cause serious problems. What should I avoid while taking phenytoin? Do not drink alcohol while you take phenytoin without first talking to your healthcare provider. Drinking alcohol while taking phenytoin may change your blood levels of phenytoin which can cause serious problems. Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how phenytoin affects you. Phenytoin can slow your thinking and motor skills. What are the possible side effects of phenytoin? See \" What is the most important information I should know about phenytoin?\" Phenytoin may cause other serious side effects including: Liver problems. Low blood count which could increase your chance of getting infections, bruising, bleeding and increased fatigue. Softening of your bones (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) can cause your bones to break (fractures). High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). High levels of phenytoin in your blood that could cause confusion also known as delirium, psychosis or a more serious condition that affects how your brain works (encephalopathy). Call your healthcare provider right away, if you have any of the symptoms listed above. The most common side effects of phenytoin include: Irregular movement of the eye (nystagmus) Problems with movement and balance (ataxia) Slurred speech Decrease in coordination Drowsiness (somnolence) Confusion Phenytoin can cause overgrowth of your gums. Brushing and flossing your teeth and seeing a dentist regularly while taking phenytoin can help prevent this from happening. These are not all of the possible side effects of phenytoin. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store phenytoin? Store Phenytoin Infatabs at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). Protect from moisture. Keep phenytoin and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of phenytoin. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Medication Guide. Do not use phenytoin for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give phenytoin to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about phenytoin that is written for health professionals. What are the ingredients in Phenytoin Infatabs? Active ingredient: 50 mg phenytoin, USP Inactive ingredients: D & C yellow No. 10, Aluminum Lake, FD&C yellow No. 6, Aluminum Lake, flavor, saccharin sodium, confectioner's sugar, talc, magnesium stearate, and purified water.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules without consulting with their healthcare provider. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence.

Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat Sores in your mouth Bruise easily Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Nausea Vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. Phenytoin can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take extended phenytoin sodium capsules if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Have had an allergic reaction to CEREBYX \u00ae (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. Take delavirdine. Before taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to extended phenytoin sodium capsules called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones Have or had liver or kidney problems Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may harm your unborn baby. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of phenytoin. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take extended phenytoin sodium capsules while you are breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the levels of phenytoin in your blood. Taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Take extended phenytoin sodium capsules exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much extended phenytoin sodium capsules to take and when to take it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed. Do not change your dose of extended phenytoin sodium capsules without talking to your healthcare provider. If your healthcare provider has prescribed phenytoin oral suspension, ask your pharmacist for a medicine dropper or medicine cup to help you measure the correct amount of phenytoin. Do not use a household teaspoon. Ask your pharmacist for instructions on how to use the measuring device the right way.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING ( 2.1 ) Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is two phenytoin chewable tablets three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily; an increase to twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily may be made, if necessary. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING. Phenytoin chewable tablets can be either chewed thoroughly before being swallowed or swallowed whole. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is two 50 mg phenytoin chewable tablets by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). If the daily dosage cannot be divided equally, the larger dose should be given before retiring. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin chewable tablets dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin chewable tablets at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin chewable tablets. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin chewable tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin chewable tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ]. Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents (usually in combination) Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lacosamide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

    "pregnancy": [
      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] .

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin chewable tablets, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed phenytoin chewable tablets are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent serum levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination Clinical studies using phenytoin chewable tablets have shown an average plasma half-life of 14 hours with a range of 7 to 29 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin chewable tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] .

Do not stop taking phenytoin chewable tablets without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping phenytoin chewable tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Like other antiepileptic drugs, phenytoin chewable tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Phenytoin chewable tablets can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat Sores in your mouth Bruise easily Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Nausea Vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking phenytoin for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. Phenytoin chewable tablets can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are phenytoin chewable tablets? Phenytoin chewable tablets is a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take phenytoin chewable tablets if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in phenytoin chewable tablets. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in phenytoin chewable tablets. Have had an allergic reaction to CEREBYX (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. Take delavirdine. Before taking phenytoin chewable tablets, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to phenytoin called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones Have or had liver or kidney problems Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Phenytoin chewable tablets may harm your unborn baby. If you take phenytoin chewable tablets during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking phenytoin chewable tablets, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of phenytoin chewable tablets.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING ( 2.1 ) Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is two phenytoin chewable tablets three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily; an increase to twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily may be made, if necessary. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING. Phenytoin chewable tablets can be either chewed thoroughly before being swallowed or swallowed whole. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is two 50 mg phenytoin chewable tablets by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). If the daily dosage cannot be divided equally, the larger dose should be given before retiring. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin chewable tablets dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin chewable tablets at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin chewable tablets. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin chewable tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin chewable tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ]. Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents (usually in combination) Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lacosamide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin chewable tablets, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed phenytoin chewable tablets are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent serum levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination Clinical studies using phenytoin chewable tablets have shown an average plasma half-life of 14 hours with a range of 7 to 29 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is two Infatabs three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be six to eight Infatabs daily; an increase to twelve Infatabs daily may be made, if necessary. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING. Phenytoin Infatabs can be either chewed thoroughly before being swallowed or swallowed whole. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is two 50 mg Infatabs by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of twelve Infatabs daily. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be six to eight Infatabs daily. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). If the daily dosage cannot be divided equally, the larger dose should be given before retiring. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in DILANTIN-125 (phenytoin) Suspension and Phenytoin Infatabs. DILANTIN (phenytoin sodium) extended capsules and parenteral DILANTIN (phenytoin sodium) are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) \u2022 Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including Phenytoin Infatabs, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing Phenytoin Infatabs or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) /Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome . Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For Phenytoin Infatabs, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed Phenytoin Infatabs are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent serum levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg DILANTIN (phenytoin sodium) extended capsules. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination Clinical studies using Phenytoin Infatabs have shown an average plasma half-life of 14 hours with a range of 7 to 29 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy : It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2\u20133% in the White population, 0.5\u20134% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15\u201336% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For Phenytoin Infatabs, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed Phenytoin Infatabs are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent serum levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg DILANTIN (phenytoin sodium) extended capsules.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including Phenytoin Infatabs, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] .

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Phenytoin Infatabs, Chewable Tablets, USP What is the most important information I should know about phenytoin? 1. Do not stop taking phenytoin without first talking to your healthcare provider. \u2022 Stopping phenytoin suddenly can cause serious problems. \u2022 Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). 2. Like other antiepileptic drugs, phenytoin may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: \u2022 Thoughts about suicide or dying \u2022 Attempts to commit suicide \u2022 New or worse depression \u2022 New or worse anxiety \u2022 Feeling agitated or restless \u2022 Panic attacks \u2022 Trouble sleeping (insomnia) \u2022 New or worse irritability \u2022 Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent \u2022 Acting on dangerous impulses \u2022 An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) \u2022 Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? \u2022 Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. \u2022 Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. 3. Phenytoin can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: \u2022 Fever \u2022 Rash \u2022 Swollen lymph glands \u2022 Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue \u2022 Trouble swallowing or breathing \u2022 Sore throat \u2022 Sores in your mouth \u2022 Bruise easily \u2022 Purple or red spots on your skin \u2022 Increase infections \u2022 Not wanting to eat (anorexia) \u2022 Nausea \u2022 Vomiting \u2022 Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking phenytoin for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. 4. Phenytoin can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: \u2022 dizziness \u2022 tiredness \u2022 feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats \u2022 chest pain What is phenytoin? Phenytoin is a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take phenytoin if you: \u2022 Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in phenytoin. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in phenytoin. \u2022 Have had an allergic reaction to CEREBYX (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). \u2022 Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. \u2022 Take delavirdine. Before taking phenytoin, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: \u2022 Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior \u2022 Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to phenytoin called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones \u2022 Have or had liver or kidney problems \u2022 Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria \u2022 Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) \u2022 Drink alcohol \u2022 Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Phenytoin may harm your unborn baby. \u2022 If you take phenytoin during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. \u2022 If you become pregnant while taking phenytoin, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of phenytoin. \u2022 If you take phenytoin during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. \u2022 All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of phenytoin. \u2022 If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking phenytoin. \u2022 Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking phenytoin, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. \u2022 Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take phenytoin while you are breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the levels of phenytoin in your blood. Taking phenytoin with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take phenytoin? \u2022 Take phenytoin exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. \u2022 Your healthcare provider will tell you how much phenytoin to take and when to take it. \u2022 Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed. Do not change your dose of phenytoin without talking to your healthcare provider. \u2022 If your healthcare provider has prescribed DILANTIN (phenytoin) oral suspension, ask your pharmacist for a medicine dropper or medicine cup to help you measure the correct amount of phenytoin. Do not use a household teaspoon. Ask your pharmacist for instructions on how to use the measuring device the right way. \u2022 Do not stop taking phenytoin without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping phenytoin suddenly can cause serious problems. What should I avoid while taking phenytoin? \u2022 Do not drink alcohol while you take phenytoin without first talking to your healthcare provider. Drinking alcohol while taking phenytoin may change your blood levels of phenytoin which can cause serious problems. \u2022 Do not drive, operate heavy machinery, or do other dangerous activities until you know how phenytoin affects you. Phenytoin can slow your thinking and motor skills. What are the possible side effects of phenytoin? See \" What is the most important information I should know about phenytoin? \" Phenytoin may cause other serious side effects including: \u2022 Liver problems. \u2022 Low blood count which could increase your chance of getting infections, bruising, bleeding and increased fatigue. \u2022 Softening of your bones (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) can cause your bones to break (fractures). \u2022 High blood sugar (hyperglycemia). \u2022 High levels of phenytoin in your blood that could cause confusion also known as delirium, psychosis or a more serious condition that affects how your brain works (encephalopathy). Call your healthcare provider right away, if you have any of the symptoms listed above. The most common side effects of phenytoin include: \u2022 Irregular movement of the eye (nystagmus) \u2022 Problems with movement and balance (ataxia) \u2022 Slurred speech \u2022 Decrease in coordination \u2022 Drowsiness (somnolence) \u2022 Confusion Phenytoin can cause overgrowth of your gums. Brushing and flossing your teeth and seeing a dentist regularly while taking phenytoin can help prevent this from happening. These are not all of the possible side effects of phenytoin. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store phenytoin? \u2022 Store Phenytoin Infatabs at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C). \u2022 Protect from moisture. Keep phenytoin and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of phenytoin. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Medication Guide. Do not use phenytoin for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give phenytoin to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about phenytoin that is written for health professionals. What are the ingredients in Phenytoin Infatabs?

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls.

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules without consulting with their healthcare provider. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence.

Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat Sores in your mouth Bruise easily Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Nausea Vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. Phenytoin can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take extended phenytoin sodium capsules if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Have had an allergic reaction to CEREBYX \u00ae (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. Take delavirdine. Before taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to extended phenytoin sodium capsules called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones Have or had liver or kidney problems Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may harm your unborn baby. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of phenytoin. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL three times daily, with dose adjustments as necessary, up to 25 mL daily. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION ONLY; NOT FOR PARENTERAL USE A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL (125 mg/5 mL), or one teaspoonful, by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements, up to a maximum of 25 mL daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ] . 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosages, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve phenytoin steady-state blood levels, and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin infatabs (chewable tablets). DILANTIN (phenytoin) extended capsules and parenteral DILANTIN (phenytoin) are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) \u2022 Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When in the judgment of the clinician the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1: Risk by Indication for Antiepileptic Drugs in the Pooled Analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug\u2019s inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \u201cdelirium,\u201d \u201cpsychosis,\u201d or \u201cencephalopathy,\u201d or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease. The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents (usually in combination) Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John\u2019s wort The induction potency of St. John\u2019s wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acidc 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ] . Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable. Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

( 5.13 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin oral suspension, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Sex/Race Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications.

However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] ."
    ],
    "pharmacogenomics": [
      "12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10 mg/kg/day, 25 mg/kg/day, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Status Epilepticus and Non-emergent Loading Dose: Adult loading dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 50 mg/min. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric loading dose is 15 to 20 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg/min, whichever is slower. ( 2.8 ) Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. ( 2.2 ) Maintenance Dosing: Initial loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection every 6 to 8 hours. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Intramuscular Administration: Because of erratic absorption and local toxicity, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should ordinarily not be given intramuscularly. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The addition of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. M onitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin in the management of status epilepticus and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin. If administration of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure : May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions : Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity : If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin.In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 orCYP2C9genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium\", \"psychosis\", or \"encephalopathy\", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see W arnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see Boxed Warning and Wa rnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Sk in and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Sp ec ial Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 1 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 1: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John\u2019s wort b , theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium, valproic acid b The induction potency of St. John\u2019s wort may vary widely based on preparation. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management : Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g.,*1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1 ). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] ."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. S e x /Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11 ). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1 % in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . P otential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic R eac tions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) \u2022 Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) \u2022 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules without consulting with their healthcare provider. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules are divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsules dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin sodium at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin sodium. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin sodium can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin sodium as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin sodium-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin sodium in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin sodium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin sodium were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids a Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium c , valproic acid c 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4)]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin sodium, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin sodium, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] ."

The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin sodium without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin sodium should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin sodium, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin sodium and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [ Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin sodium may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin sodium may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin sodium not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin sodium. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin sodium during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin sodium, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. (2.1) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. (2.1) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. (2.1) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. (2.2) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). (2.3) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules are divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsules dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. (5.1) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. (5.2) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin sodium at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. (5.3) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. (5.4) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. (5.7) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin sodium. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. (4 , 5.8) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. (5.9) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin sodium can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin sodium as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin sodium-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ]. Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin sodium in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin sodium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin sodium were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ]. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ]. A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. (7.1 , 7.2) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium 3 , valproic acid Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. (5.13 , 8.1) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ]. However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin sodium, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]."

The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide) . Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin sodium without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin sodium should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin sodium, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ]. Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin sodium and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [ Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin sodium may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin sodium may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin sodium not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin sodium. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin sodium during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin sodium, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ]. Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Dispense with Medication Guide.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules without consulting with their healthcare provider. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using extended phenytoin sodium capsules, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines.

Careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after administering intravenous phenytoin sodium injection. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate.

Intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection can also be substituted, as short-term use, for oral phenytoin. Parenteral Phenytoin should be used only when oral phenytoin administration is not possible [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.3 ) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Parenteral phenytoin sodium injection is indicated for the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus and prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Status Epilepticus and Non-emergent Loading Dose: Adult loading dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 50 mg/min. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric loading dose is 15 to 20 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg/min, whichever is slower. ( 2.8 ) Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. ( 2.2 ) Maintenance Dosing: Initial loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin sodium injection every 6 to 8 hours. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Intramuscular Administration: Because of erratic absorption and local toxicity, phenytoin sodium injection should ordinarily not be given intramuscularly. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, phenytoin sodium injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin sodium injection, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous phenytoin sodium injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous phenytoin sodium injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral phenytoin sodium injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin sodium injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The addition of parenteral phenytoin sodium injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with phenytoin sodium injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral phenytoin sodium injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral phenytoin sodium injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (phenytoin sodium injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral phenytoin sodium injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. Monitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevan t [ see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin sodium injection in the management of status epilepticus and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin sodium injection. If administration of parenteral phenytoin sodium injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin sodium injection, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin sodium injection every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, phenytoin sodium injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin sodium injection can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin sodium injection should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin sodium injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue Phenytoin sodium injection at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of phenytoin sodium injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, phenytoin sodium injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin sodium injection, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous phenytoin sodium injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens- Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. . In addition, retrospective, case control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [S ee Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9*3 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin sodium injection. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin sodium injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium injection and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium injection. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium injection. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium injection should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium injection. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration, and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous phenytoin sodium injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral phenytoin sodium injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular phenytoin sodium injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin sodium injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin, during pregnancy is about 10%, or two- to three-fold that in the general population. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium\", \"psychosis\", or \"encephalopathy\", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin sodium injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or central nervous system depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [See Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.1) , and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. An increased incidence of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects) and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome (dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities [including microcephaly], and cognitive deficits) has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and /or others) during pregnancy is about 10%, or two- to three-fold that in the general population. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 , 2.7 )] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for phenytoin sodium injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin sodium injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration phenytoin sodium injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g.,*1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Phenytoin Sodium Injection, USP is a sterile solution of 50 mg phenytoin sodium per milliliter for intravenous or intramuscular administration. The solution is in a vehicle containing 40% propylene glycol and 10% alcohol in water for injection, adjusted to pH 12 with sodium hydroxide. Phenytoin sodium is related to the barbiturates in chemical structure, but has a five-membered ring. The chemical name is sodium 5,5-diphenyl-2, 4- imidazolidinedione represented by the following structural formula: C 15 H 11 N 2 NaO 2 MW 274.25 structural formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin sodium injection IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . 12.4 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.54% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10, 25, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite.

Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats.

      "13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10 mg/kg/day, 25 mg/kg/day, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.2)]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.9) and Drug Interactions- 7 (7.1, 7.2)]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.13)]. Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions- 7 (7.2)]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations- 8 (8.1,8.2)]. Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations- 8 (8.1)].

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The addition of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. Monitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration- 2 (2.3)]. 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin in the management of status epilepticus and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin. If administration of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology- 12 (12.3)]. Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology- 12 (12.3)]. 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations- 8 (8.1)]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502. The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration- 2 (2.3)]. 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations- 8 (8.1)]. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Slow Metabolizers of Phenytoin A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be caused by limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum levels should be checked immediately. 5.13 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.14 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium\", \"psychosis\", or \"encephalopathy\", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.1)] Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.2)] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.3)] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.4)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.5)] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.6)] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.7)] Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.8)] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.10)] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.11)] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.13)] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [See Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration- 2 (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.1)]. Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.4)] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see BOXED WARNING and Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.1)] . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.6)], toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.7)]. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.7)]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.14)]. A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.3)]. There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.8)]. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease"

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. 7.1 Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 1 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 1: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations b The induction potency of St. John\u2019s wort may vary widely based on preparation. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS .1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data]. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration- 2 (2.1, 2.7)]. However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration- 2 (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology- 12 (12.3)]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration- 2 (2.6)]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration- 2 (2.6)]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions- 7 (7.1, 7.2)]."

      "13 NOCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions- 5 (5.7)] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10, 25, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.2)]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.9) and Drug Interactions 7- (7.1, 7.2)]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.13)]. Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions 7- (7.2)]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations 8- (8.1,8.2)]. Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations 8 (8.1)].

      "1 INDICATIONS & USAGE Parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is indicated for the treatment of generalized tonic-clonic status epilepticus, and prevention and treatment of seizures occurring during neurosurgery. Intravenous phenytoin can also be substituted, as short-term use, for oral phenytoin. Parenteral phenytoin should be used only when oral phenytoin administration is not possible [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The addition of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. Monitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin in the management of status epilepticus and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin. If administration of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology 12- (12.3)]. Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology 12- (12.3)]. 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations 8- (8.1)]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502. The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications 4- (4)]. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration 2- (2.3)]. 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations 8- (8.1)]. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Slow Metabolizers of Phenytoin A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be caused by limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum levels should be checked immediately. 5.13 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.14 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium\", \"psychosis\", or \"encephalopathy\", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.1)] Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.2)] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.3)] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.4)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.5)] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.6)] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.7)] Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.8)] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.10)] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.11)] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.13)] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [See Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration 2- (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.1)]. Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.4)] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see BOXED WARNING and Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.1)] . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.6)], toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.7)]. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.7)]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.14)]. A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.3)]. There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.8)]. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease"

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. 7.1 Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 1 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 1: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations b The induction potency of St. John\u2019s wort may vary widely based on preparation. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data]. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration 2- (2.1, 2.7)]. However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration 2- (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology 12- (12.3)]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration 2- (2.6)]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration 2- (2.6)]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions 7- (7.1, 7.2)]."

    "nonclinical_toxicology": [
      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions 5- (5.7)] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10, 25, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING ( 2.1 ) Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is two phenytoin chewable tablets three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily; an increase to twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily may be made, if necessary. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING. Phenytoin chewable tablets can be either chewed thoroughly before being swallowed or swallowed whole. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is two 50 mg phenytoin chewable tablets by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). If the daily dosage cannot be divided equally, the larger dose should be given before retiring. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin chewable tablets dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin chewable tablets at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin chewable tablets. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin chewable tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin chewable tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ]. Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents (usually in combination) Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lacosamide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin chewable tablets, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed phenytoin chewable tablets are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent serum levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination Clinical studies using phenytoin chewable tablets have shown an average plasma half-life of 14 hours with a range of 7 to 29 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin chewable tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

Do not stop taking phenytoin chewable tablets without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping phenytoin chewable tablets suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). 2. Like other antiepileptic drugs, phenytoin chewable tablets may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. 3. Phenytoin chewable tablets can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat Sores in your mouth Bruise easily Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Nausea Vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking phenytoin for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. 4. Phenytoin chewable tablets can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are phenytoin chewable tablets? Phenytoin chewable tablets is a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take phenytoin chewable tablets if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in phenytoin chewable tablets. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in phenytoin chewable tablets. Have had an allergic reaction to CEREBYX (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. Take delavirdine. Before taking phenytoin chewable tablets, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to phenytoin called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones Have or had liver or kidney problems Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Phenytoin chewable tablets may harm your unborn baby. If you take phenytoin chewable tablets during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking phenytoin chewable tablets, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of phenytoin chewable tablets. If you take phenytoin chewable tablets during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of phenytoin chewable tablets. If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking phenytoin chewable tablets. Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking phenytoin chewable tablets, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take phenytoin chewable tablets while you are breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the levels of phenytoin in your blood. Taking phenytoin chewable tablets with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take phenytoin chewable tablets?

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in Phenytoin-125 Suspension and Phenytoin Infatabs. Phenytoin extended capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1: Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin sodium can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin sodium-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin sodium in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug\u2019s inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \u201cdelirium,\u201d \u201cpsychosis,\u201d or \u201cencephalopathy,\u201d or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended.",
      "5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7 )] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids a Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John\u2019s wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John\u2019s wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7 )] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] .

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy : It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5% to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15% to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9 )] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin sodium and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [ Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2 )] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2 )] .

Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). 2. Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying New or worse anxiety Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Acting on dangerous impulses Attempts to commit suicide Feeling agitated or restless New or worse irritability An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) New or worse depression Panic attacks Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. 3. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Sore throat Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Rash Sores in your mouth Nausea Swollen lymph glands Bruise easily Vomiting Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. 4. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take extended phenytoin sodium capsules if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Have had an allergic reaction to CEREBYX (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. Take delavirdine. Before taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to extended phenytoin sodium capsules called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones Have or had liver or kidney problems Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may harm your unborn baby. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take extended phenytoin sodium capsules while you are breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the levels of phenytoin in your blood. Taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules with certain other medicines can cause side effects or affect how well they work. Do not start or stop other medicines without talking to your healthcare provider. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Take extended phenytoin sodium capsules exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much extended phenytoin sodium capsules to take and when to take it. Your healthcare provider may change your dose if needed. Do not change your dose of extended phenytoin sodium capsules without talking to your healthcare provider.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules without consulting with their healthcare provider. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using extended phenytoin sodium capsules, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat Sores in your mouth Bruise easily Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Nausea Vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. Phenytoin can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take extended phenytoin sodium capsules if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The additional of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. Monitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin in the management of status epileptics and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin. If administration of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may crease modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dose is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. For Status Epilepticus and Non-emergent Loading Dose: \u2022 Adult loading dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 50 mg/min.

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic mediation arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502. The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experience phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and sings resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse development outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Slow Metabolizers of Phenytoin A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be caused by limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity development, serum levels should be checked immediately. 5.13 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug\u2019s inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.14 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \u201cdelirium\u201d, \u201cpsychosis\u201d, or \u201cencephalopathy\u201d, or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended. \u2022 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. (5.2) \u2022 Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. (5.3) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. (5.4) \u2022 Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. (5.7)"

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular : Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] . Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. 7.1 Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 1 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment to the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. 7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations following fosphenytoin administration. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. (7.1, 7.2) Image1.jpg Image2.jpg"

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risk for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavior abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.7)] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digit hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions(5.1)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because of the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. \u2022 Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. (5.11, 8.1) \u2022 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. (8.6) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION. Revised: 12/2022"

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adult is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when cross over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IMG dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration, (2.6)] . Sex/Race Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal and Hepatic Impairment Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administrated in the diet to mice (10, 25, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepat0cellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk of cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)] . Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Manufactured by: Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For Status Epilepticus and Non-emergent Loading Dose: Adult loading dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 50 mg/min. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric loading dose is 15 to 20 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg/min, whichever is slower. ( 2.8 ) Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. ( 2.2 ) Maintenance Dosing: Initial loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection every 6 to 8 hours. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) Intramuscular Administration: Because of erratic absorption and local toxicity, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should ordinarily not be given intramuscularly. ( 2.2 , 2.3 ) 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The addition of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. M onitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin in the management of status epilepticus and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin. If administration of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may increase modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dosage is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure : May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions : Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity : If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium\", \"psychosis\", or \"encephalopathy\", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see W arnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Local toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of Phenytoin Sodium Injection were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Body As a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see Boxed Warning and Wa rnings and Precautions (5.1 )] . Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Sk in and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Sp ec ial Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 1 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 1: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John\u2019s wort b , theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium, valproic acid b The induction potency of St. John\u2019s wort may vary widely based on preparation. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management : Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy P regnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g.,*1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1 ). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] ."

Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively."

Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when crossed over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IM dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. S e x /Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. P regnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11 ). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1 % in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . P otential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic R eac tions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2) ] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules without consulting with their healthcare provider. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] .

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1 General Dosing Information Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration, intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, the drug should be administered at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the intravenous (IV) catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation due to the alkalinity of the solution. Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be given diluted with normal saline. The additional of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection to dextrose and dextrose-containing solutions should be avoided due to lack of solubility and resultant precipitation. Treatment with Phenytoin Sodium Injection can be initiated either with a loading dose or an infusion: Loading Dose: A loading dose of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly, not exceeding 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Infusion: For infusion administration, parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be diluted in normal saline with the final concentration of phenytoin sodium in the solution no less than 5 mg/mL. Administration should commence immediately after the mixture has been prepared and must be completed within 1 to 4 hours (the infusion mixture should not be refrigerated). An in-line filter (0.22 to 0.55 microns) should be used. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution or container permit. The diluted infusion mixture (Phenytoin Sodium Injection plus normal saline) should not be refrigerated. If the undiluted parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection is refrigerated or frozen, a precipitate might form: this will dissolve again after the solution is allowed to stand at room temperature. The product is still suitable for use. A faint yellow coloration may develop, however this has no effect on the potency of the solution. For single-dose only. After opening, any unused product should be discarded. Monitoring Levels: Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 2.2 Status Epilepticus In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly intravenously, at a rate not exceeding 50 mg per minute (this will require approximately 20 minutes in a 70-kg patient). The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of 100 mg orally or intravenously every 6 to 8 hours. In the pediatric population, a loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of phenytoin sodium intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram and blood pressure is essential. The patient should be observed for signs of respiratory depression. Determination of phenytoin serum levels is advised when using phenytoin in the management of status epileptics and in the subsequent establishment of maintenance dosage. Other measures, including concomitant administration of an intravenous benzodiazepine such as diazepam, or an intravenous short-acting barbiturate, will usually be necessary for rapid control of seizures because of the required slow rate of administration of phenytoin. If administration of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection does not terminate seizures, the use of other anticonvulsants, intravenous barbiturates, general anesthesia, and other appropriate measures should be considered. Intramuscular administration should not be used in the treatment of status epilepticus because the attainment of peak serum levels may require up to 24 hours. 2.3 Non-emergent Loading and Maintenance Dosing Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. In adults, a loading dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg should be administered slowly. The rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. Slower administration rates are recommended to minimize the cardiovascular adverse reactions. Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. The loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous phenytoin every 6 to 8 hours. Ordinarily, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should not be given intramuscularly because of the risk of necrosis, abscess formation, and erratic absorption. If intramuscular administration is required, compensating dosage adjustments are necessary to maintain therapeutic serum levels. An intramuscular dose 50% greater than the oral dose is necessary to maintain these levels. When returned to oral administration, the dose should be reduced by 50% of the original oral dose for one week to prevent excessive serum levels due to sustained release from intramuscular tissue sites. Monitoring serum levels would help prevent a fall into the subtherapeutic range. Serum blood level determinations are especially helpful when possible drug interactions are suspected. 2.4 Parenteral Substitution for Oral Phenytoin Therapy When treatment with oral phenytoin is not possible, IV phenytoin can be substituted for oral phenytoin at the same total daily dose. Phenytoin capsules are approximately 90% bioavailable by the oral route. Phenytoin is 100% bioavailable by the IV route. For this reason, serum phenytoin concentrations may crease modestly when IV phenytoin is substituted for oral phenytoin sodium therapy. The rate of administration for IV phenytoin should be no greater than 50 mg per minute in adults and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients. When intramuscular administration may be required, a sufficient dose must be administered intramuscularly to maintain the serum level within the therapeutic range. Where oral dose is resumed following intramuscular usage, the oral dose should be properly adjusted to compensate for the slow, continuing IM absorption to minimize toxic symptoms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Serum concentrations should be monitored and care should be taken when switching a patient from the sodium salt to the free acid form. Phenytoin Sodium Injection is formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 2.6 Dosing in Geriatrics Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.7 Dosing During Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the Phenytoin Sodium Injection dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction. 2.8 Dosing in Pediatrics A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). The drug should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. For Status Epilepticus and Non-emergent Loading Dose: \u2022 Adult loading dose is 10 to 15 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 50 mg/min. (2.2) \u2022 Pediatric loading dose is 15 to 20 mg/kg at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg/min, whichever is slower. (2.8) \u2022 Continuous monitoring of the electrocardiogram, blood pressure, and respiratory function is essential. (2.2) Maintenance Dosing: \u2022 Initial loading dose should be followed by maintenance doses of oral or intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection every 6 to 8 hours. (2.2, 2.3) Intramuscular Administration: \u2022 Because of erratic absorption and local toxicity, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should ordinarily not be given intramuscularly. (2.2, 2.3)"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS 5.1 Cardiovascular Risk Associated with Rapid Infusion Rapid intravenous administration of Phenytoin Sodium Injection increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions, including severe hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac arrhythmias have included bradycardia, heart block, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation which have resulted in asystole, cardiac arrest, and death. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in critically ill patients, elderly patients, and patients with hypotension and severe myocardial insufficiency. However, cardiac events have also been reported in adults and children without underlying cardiac disease or comorbidities and at recommended doses and infusion rates. Intravenous administration should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults. In pediatric patients, administer the drug at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower. Although the risk of cardiovascular toxicity increases with infusion rates above the recommended infusion rate, these events have also been reported at or below the recommended infusion rate. As non-emergency therapy, Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered more slowly as either a loading dose or by intermittent infusion. Because of the risks of cardiac and local toxicity associated with intravenous phenytoin, oral phenytoin should be used whenever possible. Because adverse cardiovascular reactions have occurred during and after infusions, careful cardiac and respiratory monitoring is needed during and after the administration of intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection. Reduction in rate of administration or discontinuation of dosing may be needed. 5.2 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Antiepileptic drugs should not be abruptly discontinued because of the possibility of increased seizure frequency, including status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative antiepileptic medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an antiepileptic drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding Phenytoin Sodium Injection as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan Hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)]. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not re-administered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs resembling DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Local Toxicity (Including Purple Glove Syndrome) Soft tissue irritation and inflammation has occurred at the site of injection with and without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin. Edema, discoloration and pain distal to the site of injection (described as \u201cpurple glove syndrome\u201d) have also been reported following peripheral intravenous phenytoin injection. Soft tissue irritation may vary from slight tenderness to extensive necrosis, and sloughing. The syndrome may not develop for several days after injection. Although resolution of symptoms may be spontaneous, skin necrosis and limb ischemia have occurred and required such interventions as fasciotomies, skin grafting, and, in rare cases, amputation. Because of the risk of local toxicity, intravenous Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be administered directly into a large peripheral or central vein through a large-gauge catheter. Prior to the administration, the patency of the IV catheter should be tested with a flush of sterile saline. Each injection of parenteral Phenytoin Sodium Injection should then be followed by a flush of sterile saline through the same catheter to avoid local venous irritation caused by the alkalinity of the solution. Intramuscular Phenytoin Sodium Injection administration may cause pain, necrosis, and abscess formation at the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin Sodium Injection may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effect on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.13 Serum Phenytoin Levels Above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium\", \"psychosis\", or \"encephalopathy\", or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended. \u2022 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. (5.2) \u2022 Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. (5.3) \u2022 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. (5.4) \u2022 Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. (5.7)"

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The most notable signs of toxicity associated with the intravenous use of this drug are cardiovascular collapse and/or CNS depression. Hypotension does occur when the drug is administered rapidly by the intravenous route. The rate of administration is very important; it should not exceed 50 mg per minute in adults, and 1 to 3 mg/kg/min (or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower) in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning, Dosage and Administration (2.1), and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms (see Skin and Appendages paragraph below) and DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] have been observed. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Cardiovascular: Severe cardiovascular events and fatalities have been reported with atrial and ventricular conduction depression and ventricular fibrillation. Severe complications are most commonly encountered in elderly or critically ill patients [see Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)], toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy, including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s Disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may also cause increased serum levels of glucose, alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesia, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)]. A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Local irritation, inflammation, tenderness, necrosis, and sloughing have been reported with or without extravasation of intravenous phenytoin [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. 7.1 Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 1 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment to the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. 7.3 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations following fosphenytoin administration. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. (7.1, 7.2) Image1.jpg Image2.jpg"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as Phenytoin Sodium Injection, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risk for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations (including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects). In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data]. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavior abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.1, 2.7)]. However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantion syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digit hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth retardation. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Phenytoin Sodium Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Phenytoin Sodium Injection or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use A loading dose of 15 to 20 mg/kg of Phenytoin Sodium Injection intravenously will usually produce serum concentrations of phenytoin within the generally accepted serum total concentrations between 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Because of the increased risk of adverse cardiovascular reactions associated with rapid administration Phenytoin Sodium Injection should be injected slowly intravenously at a rate not exceeding 1 to 3 mg/kg/min or 50 mg per minute, whichever is slower [see Dosage and Administration (2.8) and Warnings and Precautions(5.1)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the site of biotransformation. Patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early toxicity. Because of the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g.,*1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1 ). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. \u2022 Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. (5.11, 8.1) \u2022 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. (8.6) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION. Revised: 12/2022"

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adult is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption A fall in serum levels may occur when patients are changed from oral to intramuscular administration. The drop is caused by slower absorption, as compared to oral administration, because of the poor water solubility of phenytoin. Intravenous administration is the preferred route for producing rapid therapeutic serum levels. Patients stabilized on a daily oral regimen of phenytoin experience a drop in peak blood levels to 50 to 60 percent of stable levels if crossed over to an equal dose administered intramuscularly. However, the intramuscular depot of poorly soluble material is eventually absorbed, as determined by urinary excretion of 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (HPPH), the principal metabolite, as well as the total amount of drug eventually appearing in the blood. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. A short-term (one week) study indicates that patients do not experience the expected drop in blood levels when cross over to the intramuscular route if the phenytoin IMG dose is increased by 50 percent over the previously established oral dose. To avoid drug accumulation caused by absorption from the muscle depots, it is recommended that for the first week back on oral phenytoin, the dose be reduced to half of the original oral dose (one-third of the IM dose). Experience for periods greater than one week is lacking and blood level monitoring is recommended. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs most often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL). Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Elimination The serum half-life in man after intravenous administration ranges from 10 to 15 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly by glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration, (2.6)]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal and Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11 ). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1 % in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administrated in the diet to mice (10, 25, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepat0cellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7)]. Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., cimetidine and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)]. Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk of cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1, 8.2)]. Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Manufactured by: Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules are divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsules dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin sodium at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin sodium. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin sodium can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin sodium as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin sodium-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin sodium in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin sodium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin sodium were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids a Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium c , valproic acid c 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4)]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes.

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin sodium, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin sodium without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin sodium should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin sodium, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin sodium and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [ Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin sodium may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin sodium may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin sodium not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin sodium. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin sodium during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin sodium, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] .

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Extended Phenytoin Sodium Capsules USP ( fen' i toyn soe' dee um) What is the most important information I should know about extended phenytoin sodium capsules? 1. Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). 2. Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. 3. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat Sores in your mouth Bruise easily Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Nausea Vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. 4. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take extended phenytoin sodium capsules if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Have had an allergic reaction to CEREBYX (fosphenytoin), PEGANONE (ethotoin), or MESANTOIN (mephenytoin). Have had liver problems from taking phenytoin. Take delavirdine. Before taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: Have or have had depression, mood problems, or suicidal thoughts or behavior Have had an allergic reaction to a medicine similar to extended phenytoin sodium capsules called carboxamides, barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones Have or had liver or kidney problems Have or had an enzyme problem called porphyria Have or had high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) Drink alcohol Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may harm your unborn baby. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, the level of extended phenytoin sodium capsules in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry. You can enroll in this registry by calling 1-888-233-2334. The purpose of this registry is to collect information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Phenytoin sodium can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will take extended phenytoin sodium capsules while you are breastfeeding. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. These medicines can change the levels of extended phenytoin sodium capsules in your blood.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules are divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsules dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin sodium at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin sodium. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin sodium can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin sodium as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin sodium. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin sodium-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin sodium in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin sodium should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin sodium. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin sodium may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids a Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium c , valproic acid c 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4)]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin sodium, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment : Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin sodium without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin sodium should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin sodium, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin sodium and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [ Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin sodium may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin sodium may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin sodium not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin sodium. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin sodium during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin sodium, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] .

Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady- state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules are divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsules dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. (5.1) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. (5.2) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. (5.3) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. (5.4) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. (5.6) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. (5.7) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. (5.9) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended Phenytoin Sodium Capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended Phenytoin Sodium Capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding extended phenytoin sodium capsules as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in extended phenytoin sodium capsules-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7 )] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15 )] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, includingnystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. c Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole- trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids a Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium c , valproic acid c 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin a The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4)]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. (5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia : Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.7 )] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5\u20137 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5-7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population : Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/ Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2 )] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. (2.1) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. (2.1) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. (2.1) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. (2.2) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). (2.3) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules are divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)] . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin-125 oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)]. 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsules dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. (5.1) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. (5.2) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. (5.3) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. (5.4) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. (5.6) Angioedema : Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. (5.7) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. (4, 5.8) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. (5.9) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy Psychiatric Other Total 1.0 5.7 1.0 2.4 3.4 8.5 1.8 4.3 3.5 1.5 1.9 1.8 2.4 2.9 0.9 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLAB* 1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding extended phenytoin sodium capsules as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in extended phenytoin sodium capsules-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10)] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero. This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug\u2019s inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \u201cdelirium,\u201d \u201cpsychosis,\u201d or \u201cencephalopathy,\u201d or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4, 5.7 )]. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15)] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. (7.1 , 7.2) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazoletrimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids a Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John\u2019s wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium c , valproic acid c a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John\u2019s wort may vary widely based on preparation. C Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4)]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. (5.13, 8.1) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. (8.6) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data]. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.7)]. However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5)]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5\u20137 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5\u20137 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy : It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [ see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7)] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9)] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10, 25, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule, USP by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules, USP is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications.

However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10 mg/kg/day, 25 mg/kg/day, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may harm your unborn baby. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of phenytoin. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying Attempts to commit suicide New or worse depression New or worse anxiety Feeling agitated or restless Panic attacks Trouble sleeping (insomnia) New or worse irritability Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Acting on dangerous impulses An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Rash Swollen lymph glands Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Sore throat Sores in your mouth Bruise easily Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Nausea Vomiting Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. Phenytoin can cause problems with your heart, including a slow heartbeat. Let your healthcare provider know right away if you have any of these symptoms: dizziness tiredness feeling like your heart is beating slowly or skipping beats chest pain What are extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take extended phenytoin sodium capsules if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules.

Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may harm your unborn baby. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is at risk for serious birth defects. If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, the level of phenytoin in your blood may decrease, causing your seizures to become worse. Your healthcare provider may change your dose of phenytoin. If you take extended phenytoin sodium capsules during pregnancy, your baby is also at risk for bleeding problems right after birth. Your healthcare provider may give you and your baby medicine to prevent this. All women of child-bearing age should talk to their healthcare provider about using other possible treatments instead of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If you are of childbearing age and are not planning on getting pregnant, you should use effective birth control (contraception) while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Pregnancy Registry: If you become pregnant while taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules, talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the North American Antiepileptic Drug Pregnancy Registry.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING ( 2.1 ) Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is two phenytoin chewable tablets three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily; an increase to twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily may be made, if necessary. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.4 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions NOT FOR ONCE-A-DAY DOSING. Phenytoin chewable tablets can be either chewed thoroughly before being swallowed or swallowed whole. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is two 50 mg phenytoin chewable tablets by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of twelve phenytoin chewable tablets daily. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be six to eight phenytoin chewable tablets daily. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). If the daily dosage cannot be divided equally, the larger dose should be given before retiring. 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin chewable tablets dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin chewable tablets at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin chewable tablets. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin chewable tablets, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin chewable tablets or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. phenytion-table1 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ]. Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. phenytoin-table2 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. phenytoin-table3 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/. Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ] . In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin chewable tablets, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Clinical studies show that chewed and unchewed phenytoin chewable tablets are bioequivalent, yield approximately equivalent serum levels, and are more rapidly absorbed than 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination Clinical studies using phenytoin chewable tablets have shown an average plasma half-life of 14 hours with a range of 7 to 29 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration, (2.7) ] . Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2-3% in the White population, 0.5-4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15-36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin chewable tablets, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ] . Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management : Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 mcg/mL and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the extended phenytoin sodium capsule dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue extended phenytoin sodium capsules at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 years to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium capsules or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ] . The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium capsules and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium capsules. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with extended phenytoin sodium capsules in the postmarketing setting. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium capsules should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium capsules. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed, as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] . Pure red cell aplasia has also been reported. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted.

Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine, lacosamide Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium capsules, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3 , 2.7) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for extended phenytoin sodium capsules and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from extended phenytoin sodium capsules or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] ."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] In carcinogenicity studies, phenytoin was administered in the diet to mice (10 mg/kg/day, 25 mg/kg/day, or 45 mg/kg/day) and rats (25 mg/kg/day, 50 mg/kg/day, or 100 mg/kg/day) for 2 years. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 160 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule three times a day, with dose adjustments as necessary. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dose will be one capsule three to four times a day. An increase, up to two capsules three times a day may be made, if necessary. ( 2.1 ) Adult once-a-day dose: If seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. ( 2.1 ) Adult loading dose: reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desired. Refer to full prescribing information. ( 2.1 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.2 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments\u2014the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Adult Dosage Divided daily dosage: The recommended starting dose for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is one 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsule by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements up to a maximum of two capsules three times a day. For most adults, the satisfactory maintenance dosage will be one capsule three to four times a day. Once-a-day dosage: In adults, if seizure control is established with divided doses of three 100-mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules daily, once-a-day dosage with 300 mg of extended phenytoin sodium capsules may be considered. Studies comparing divided doses of 300 mg with a single daily dose of this quantity indicated absorption, peak serum levels, biologic half-life, difference between peak and minimum values, and urinary recovery were equivalent. Once-a-day dosage offers a convenience to the individual patient or to nursing personnel for institutionalized patients and is intended to be used only for patients requiring this amount of drug daily. A major problem in motivating noncompliant patients may also be lessened when the patient can take this drug once a day. However, patients should be cautioned not to miss a dose, inadvertently. Only extended phenytoin sodium capsules are recommended for once-a-day dosing. Inherent differences in dissolution characteristics and resultant absorption rates of phenytoin due to different manufacturing procedures and/or dosage forms preclude such recommendation for other phenytoin products. When a change in the dosage form or brand is prescribed, careful monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be carried out. Loading dose: Some authorities have advocated use of an oral loading dose of phenytoin in adults who require rapid steady-state serum levels and where intravenous administration is not desirable. This dosing regimen should be reserved for patients in a clinic or hospital setting where phenytoin serum levels can be closely monitored. Patients with a history of renal or liver disease should not receive the oral loading regimen. Initially, one gram of extended phenytoin sodium capsules is divided into three doses (400 mg, 300 mg, 300 mg) and administered at two-hour intervals. Normal maintenance dosage is then instituted 24 hours after the loading dose, with frequent serum level determinations. 2.2 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.3 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient\u2019s next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual\u2019s threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations between 1 and 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. With recommended dosage, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve steady-state blood levels with phenytoin and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.4 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in Phenytoin -125 Suspension and Phenytoin Infatabs. Phenytoin extended capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.5 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . 2.6 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.7 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.6 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When, in the judgment of the clinician, the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant drug not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including extended phenytoin sodium, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/ Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing extended phenytoin sodium or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Serious and sometimes fatal dermatologic reactions, including toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), have been reported with phenytoin treatment. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Extended phenytoin sodium should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA-B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502. The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including extended phenytoin sodium. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Extended phenytoin sodium should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Extended phenytoin sodium and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4)] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to extended phenytoin sodium. 5.6 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with extended phenytoin sodium. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, extended phenytoin sodium should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.7 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of extended phenytoin sodium. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] . In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.8 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.9 Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.10 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.11 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse development outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin, during pregnancy is about 10%, or two- to three-fold that in the general population. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.12 Slow Metabolizers of Phenytoin A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be caused by limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose-related CNS toxicity develop, serum levels should be checked immediately. 5.13 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug\u2019s inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.14 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \u201cdelirium,\u201d \u201cpsychosis,\u201d or \u201cencephalopathy,\u201d or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.11)] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3, 5.4) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)] , toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin\u2019s disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)] . Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of T4. It may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] , alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.14)] . A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie\u2019s disease To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS contact AvKARE at 1-855-361-3993; email drugsafety@avkare.com; or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19, and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids a Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents usually in combination Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John\u2019s wort b , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium, valproic acid a Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. b The induction potency of St. John\u2019s wort may vary widely based on preparation. 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4)]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is co-administered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Antiepileptic drugs a Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir. Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine a The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable 7.3 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. ( 5.11 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as extended phenytoin sodium, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking extended phenytoin sodium enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse development outcomes. An increased incidence of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects) and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome (dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities [including microcephaly], and cognitive deficits) has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and/or others) during pregnancy is about 10%, or two- to three-fold that in the general population. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.7 )] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Animal data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment, or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients."

Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse development outcomes. An increased incidence of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects) and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome (dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities [including microcephaly], and cognitive deficits) has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The overall incidence of malformations for children of epileptic women treated with antiepileptic drugs (phenytoin and/or others) during pregnancy is about 10%, or two- to three-fold that in the general population. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3, 2.7 )] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Animal data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100, 75, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively."

    "overdosage": [
      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL; dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For extended phenytoin sodium capsules, peak serum levels occur 4 to 12 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.6)]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy : It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] ."

The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in male and female mice at the highest dose. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. The highest doses tested in these studies were associated with peak serum phenytoin levels below human therapeutic concentrations. In carcinogenicity studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was administered in the diet for 2 years at doses up to 600 ppm (approximately 90 mg/kg/day) to mice and up to 2,400 ppm (approximately 120 mg/kg/day) to rats. The incidences of hepatocellular tumors were increased in female mice at all but the lowest dose tested. No increases in tumor incidence were observed in rats. Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Advise patients not to use capsules which are discolored. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including extended phenytoin sodium capsules, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] . Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.6 , 5.7 )] . Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician\u2019s advice [ Drug Interactions ( 7.1 , 7.2 )] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John\u2019s wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13)] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2)]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breast feeding or intend to breast feed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 , 8.2 )] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant.

      "MEDICATION GUIDE Extended phenytoin (FEN-i-toyn) sodium oral capsules What is the most important information I should know about extended phenytoin sodium capsules? 1. Do not stop taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules without first talking to your healthcare provider. Stopping extended phenytoin sodium capsules suddenly can cause serious problems. Stopping a seizure medicine suddenly can cause you to have seizures more often or seizures that will not stop (status epilepticus). 2. Like other antiepileptic drugs, extended phenytoin sodium capsules may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500. Call a healthcare provider right away if you have any of these symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: Thoughts about suicide or dying New or worse anxiety Trouble sleeping (insomnia) Acting on dangerous impulses Attempts to commit suicide Feeling agitated or restless New or worse irritability An extreme increase in activity and talking (mania) New or worse depression Panic attacks Acting aggressive, being angry, or violent Other unusual changes in behavior or mood Suicidal thoughts or actions can be caused by things other than medicines. If you have suicidal thoughts or actions, your healthcare provider may check for other causes. How can I watch for early symptoms of suicidal thoughts and actions? Pay attention to any changes, especially sudden changes, in mood, behaviors, thoughts, or feelings. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you are worried about symptoms. 3. Extended phenytoin sodium capsules can cause a type of serious allergic reaction that may affect different parts of the body such as your liver, kidneys, blood, heart, skin or other parts of your body. These can be very serious and cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have any or all of these symptoms: Fever Sore throat Not wanting to eat (anorexia) Rash Sores in your mouth Nausea Swollen lymph glands Bruise easily Vomiting Swelling of your face, eye, lips, or tongue Trouble swallowing or breathing Purple or red spots on your skin Increase infections Yellowing of the skin and the white part of your eyes (jaundice) Call your healthcare provider even if the symptoms are mild or if you have been taking extended phenytoin sodium capsules for an extended period of time. These symptoms can be a sign of a serious allergic reaction. What are extended phenytoin sodium capsules? Extended phenytoin sodium capsules are a prescription medicine used to treat certain types of seizures called tonic-clonic (grand mal) and psychomotor (temporal lobe) seizures. Do not take extended phenytoin sodium capsules if you: Are allergic to phenytoin or any of the ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules. See the end of this leaflet for a complete list of ingredients in extended phenytoin sodium capsules.

    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Adult starting dose in patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL three times daily, with dose adjustments as necessary, up to 25 mL daily. ( 2.2 ) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. ( 2.3 ) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments-the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION ONLY; NOT FOR PARENTERAL USE A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL (125 mg/5 mL), or one teaspoonful, by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements, up to a maximum of 25 mL daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. With recommended dosages, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve phenytoin steady-state blood levels, and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and phenytoin chewable tablets. Phenytoin extended capsules and parenteral phenytoin are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure: May precipitate status epilepticus. Dose reductions or discontinuation should be done gradually. ( 5.1 ) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. ( 5.2 ) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin oral suspension at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. ( 5.3 ) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. ( 5.4 ) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. ( 5.6 ) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. ( 5.7 ) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin oral suspension. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. ( 4 , 5.8 ) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When in the judgment of the clinician the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophelia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502.Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. Consideration should be given to avoiding phenytoin as an alternative for carbamazepine in patients positive for HLA-B*1502. The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied.The use of HLA-B*1502 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] . Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ] . Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the post marketing setting. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] . Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Slow Metabolizers of Phenytoin A small percentage of individuals who have been treated with phenytoin have been shown to metabolize the drug slowly. Slow metabolism may be caused by limited enzyme availability and lack of induction; it appears to be genetically determined. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum levels should be checked immediately. 5.15 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.16 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7) ] . Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ]. A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

    "drug_interactions": [
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes. ( 7.1 , 7.2 ) 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome.

However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management : Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.4 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

( 5.13 , 8.1 ) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the toll free number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data ] . There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data ]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ] . However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients."

Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] . Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin oral suspension, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ] . Sex/Race Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9 and CYP2C19.

Mutagenesis Phenytoin was negative in the Ames test and in the in vitro clastogenicity assay in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. In studies reported in the literature, phenytoin was negative in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay in mouse. Phenytoin was clastogenic in the in vitro sister chromatid exchange assay in CHO cells. Fertility Phenytoin has not been adequately assessed for effects on male or female fertility."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise patients to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Medication Guide). Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Instruct patients to use an accurately calibrated measuring device when using this medication to ensure accurate dosing. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ] . Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ] . Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin oral suspension and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications. Neurologic Effects Counsel patients that phenytoin may cause dizziness, gait disturbance, decreased coordination and somnolence. Advise patients taking phenytoin not to drive, operate complex machinery, or engage in other hazardous activities until they have become accustomed to any such effects associated with phenytoin. Use in Pregnancy Inform pregnant women and women of childbearing potential that use of phenytoin during pregnancy can cause fetal harm, including an increased risk for cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts), cardiac defects, dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits. When appropriate, counsel pregnant women and women of childbearing potential about alternative therapeutic options. Advise women of childbearing potential who are not planning a pregnancy to use effective contraception while using phenytoin, keeping in mind that there is a potential for decreased hormonal contraceptive efficacy [see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during therapy, and to notify their physician if they are breastfeeding or intend to breastfeed during therapy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.2) ] . Encourage patients to enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry if they become pregnant. This registry is collecting information about the safety of antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ] ."

(2.2) Pediatric starting dose is 5 mg/kg/day in two to three equally divided doses, with dosage adjustments as necessary, up to a maximum of 300 mg daily. Maintenance dosage is 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day. (2.3) Serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments \u2013 the clinically effective serum total concentration is 10 mcg/mL to 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentration is 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL). (2.1) 2.1 Important Administration Instructions FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION ONLY; NOT FOR PARENTERAL USE A calibrated measuring device is recommended to measure and deliver the prescribed dose accurately. A household teaspoon or tablespoon is not an adequate measuring device. 2.2 Adult Dosage The recommended starting dosage for adult patients who have received no previous treatment is 5 mL (125 mg/5 mL), or one teaspoonful, by mouth three times daily. Adjust the dosage to suit individual requirements, up to a maximum of 25 mL daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 2.3 Pediatric Dosage The recommended starting dosage for pediatric patients is 5 mg/kg/day by mouth in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily in divided doses. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg/day to 8 mg/kg/day in equally divided doses. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day). 2.4 Dosage Adjustments Dosage should be individualized to provide maximum benefit. In some cases, serum blood level determinations may be necessary for optimal dosage adjustments. Trough levels provide information about clinically effective serum level range and confirm patient compliance, and are obtained just prior to the patient's next scheduled dose. Peak levels indicate an individual's threshold for emergence of dose-related side effects and are obtained at the time of expected peak concentration. Therapeutic effect without clinical signs of toxicity occurs more often with serum total concentrations between 10 mcg/mL and 20 mcg/mL (unbound phenytoin concentrations of 1 mcg/mL to 2 mcg/mL), although some mild cases of tonic-clonic (grand mal) epilepsy may be controlled with lower serum levels of phenytoin. In patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of unbound phenytoin concentrations may be more relevant [see Dosage and Administration (2.6) ]. With recommended dosages, a period of seven to ten days may be required to achieve phenytoin steady-state blood levels, and changes in dosage (increase or decrease) should not be carried out at intervals shorter than seven to ten days. 2.5 Switching Between Phenytoin Formulations The free acid form of phenytoin is used in phenytoin oral suspension and DILANTIN Infatabs. DILANTIN extended capsules and parenteral DILANTIN are formulated with the sodium salt of phenytoin. Because there is approximately an 8% increase in drug content with the free acid form over that of the sodium salt, dosage adjustments and serum level monitoring may be necessary when switching from a product formulated with the free acid to a product formulated with the sodium salt and vice versa. 2.6 Dosing in Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ]. 2.7 Geriatric Dosage Phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients and lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.8 Dosing during Pregnancy Decreased serum concentrations of phenytoin may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations should be performed during pregnancy, and the phenytoin oral suspension dosage should be adjusted as necessary. Postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Because of potential changes in protein binding during pregnancy, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction."

(5.1) Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Monitor patients for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. (5.2) Serious Dermatologic Reactions: Discontinue phenytoin oral suspension at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest SJS/TEN, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. (5.3) Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity: If signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity are present, evaluate the patient immediately. Discontinue if an alternative etiology cannot be established. (5.4) Cardiac Effects: Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported. (5.6) Angioedema: Discontinue immediately if symptoms of angioedema such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. (5.7) Hepatic Injury: Cases of acute hepatotoxicity have been reported with phenytoin oral suspension. If this occurs, immediately discontinue. (4 , 5.8) Hematopoietic Complications: If occurs, follow-up observation is indicated and an alternative antiepileptic treatment should be used. (5.9) 5.1 Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus Abrupt withdrawal of phenytoin in epileptic patients may precipitate status epilepticus. When in the judgment of the clinician the need for dosage reduction, discontinuation, or substitution of alternative anticonvulsant medication arises, this should be done gradually. However, in the event of an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, more rapid substitution of alternative therapy may be necessary. In this case, alternative therapy should be an anticonvulsant not belonging to the hydantoin chemical class. 5.2 Suicidal Behavior and Ideation Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), including phenytoin, increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with any AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or behavior, and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Pooled analyses of 199 placebo-controlled clinical trials (mono- and adjunctive therapy) of 11 different AEDs showed that patients randomized to one of the AEDs had approximately twice the risk (adjusted Relative Risk 1.8, 95% CI:1.2, 2.7) of suicidal thinking or behavior compared to patients randomized to placebo. In these trials, which had a median treatment duration of 12 weeks, the estimated incidence rate of suicidal behavior or ideation among 27,863 AED-treated patients was 0.43%, compared to 0.24% among 16,029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The increased risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with AEDs was observed as early as one week after starting drug treatment with AEDs and persisted for the duration of treatment assessed. Because most trials included in the analysis did not extend beyond 24 weeks, the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior beyond 24 weeks could not be assessed. The risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior was generally consistent among drugs in the data analyzed. The finding of increased risk with AEDs of varying mechanisms of action and across a range of indications suggests that the risk applies to all AEDs used for any indication. The risk did not vary substantially by age (5 to 100 years) in the clinical trials analyzed. Table 1 shows absolute and relative risk by indication for all evaluated AEDs. Table 1 Risk by indication for antiepileptic drugs in the pooled analysis Indication Placebo Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Relative Risk: Incidence of Events in Drug Patients/Incidence in Placebo Patients Risk Difference: Additional Drug Patients with Events Per 1000 Patients Epilepsy 1.0 3.4 3.5 2.4 Psychiatric 5.7 8.5 1.5 2.9 Other 1.0 1.8 1.9 0.9 Total 2.4 4.3 1.8 1.9 The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing phenytoin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior. Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be informed that AEDs increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and should be advised of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of the signs and symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers. 5.3 Serious Dermatologic Reactions Phenytoin can cause severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), which may be fatal. Reported reactions in phenytoin-treated patients have included toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. The onset of symptoms is usually within 28 days, but can occur later. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued at the first sign of a rash, unless the rash is clearly not drug-related. If signs or symptoms suggest a severe cutaneous adverse reaction, use of this drug should not be resumed and alternative therapy should be considered. If a rash occurs, the patient should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of SCARs. Studies in patients of Chinese ancestry have found a strong association between the risk of developing SJS/TEN and the presence of HLA-B*1502, an inherited allelic variant of the HLA B gene, in patients using carbamazepine. Limited evidence suggests that HLA-B*1502 may be a risk factor for the development of SJS/TEN in patients of Asian ancestry taking other antiepileptic drugs associated with SJS/TEN, including phenytoin. In addition, retrospective, case-control, genome-wide association studies in patients of southeast Asian ancestry have also identified an increased risk of SCARs in carriers of the decreased function CYP2C9*3 variant, which has also been associated with decreased clearance of phenytoin. Consider avoiding phenytoin oral suspension as an alternative to carbamazepine in patients who are positive for HLA-B*1502 or in CYP2C9*3 carriers [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]. The use of HLA-B*1502 or CYP2C9 genotyping has important limitations and must never substitute for appropriate clinical vigilance and patient management. The role of other possible factors in the development of, and morbidity from, SJS/TEN, such as antiepileptic drug (AED) dose, compliance, concomitant medications, comorbidities, and the level of dermatologic monitoring have not been studied. 5.4 Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), also known as Multiorgan hypersensitivity, has been reported in patients taking antiepileptic drugs, including phenytoin. Some of these events have been fatal or life-threatening. DRESS typically, although not exclusively, presents with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, and/or facial swelling, in association with other organ system involvement, such as hepatitis, nephritis, hematological abnormalities, myocarditis, or myositis sometimes resembling an acute viral infection. Eosinophilia is often present. Because this disorder is variable in its expression, other organ systems not noted here may be involved. It is important to note that early manifestations of hypersensitivity, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, may be present even though rash is not evident. If such signs or symptoms are present, the patient should be evaluated immediately. Phenytoin should be discontinued if an alternative etiology for the signs or symptoms cannot be established. 5.5 Hypersensitivity Phenytoin and other hydantoins are contraindicated in patients who have experienced phenytoin hypersensitivity [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Additionally, consider alternatives to structurally similar drugs such as carboxamides (e.g., carbamazepine), barbiturates, succinimides, and oxazolidinediones (e.g., trimethadione) in these same patients. Similarly, if there is a history of hypersensitivity reactions to these structurally similar drugs in the patient or immediate family members, consider alternatives to phenytoin. 5.6 Cardiac Effects Cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported in phenytoin-treated patients, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity [see Overdosage (10) ]. Most of the reports of cardiac arrest occurred in patients with underlying cardiac disease. 5.7 Angioedema Angioedema has been reported in patients treated with phenytoin in the postmarketing setting. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued immediately if symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling occur. Phenytoin oral suspension should be discontinued permanently if a clear alternative etiology for the reaction cannot be established. 5.8 Hepatic Injury Cases of acute hepatotoxicity, including infrequent cases of acute hepatic failure, have been reported with phenytoin. These events may be part of the spectrum of DRESS or may occur in isolation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. Other common manifestations include jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated serum transaminase levels, leukocytosis, and eosinophilia. The clinical course of acute phenytoin hepatotoxicity ranges from prompt recovery to fatal outcomes. In these patients with acute hepatotoxicity, phenytoin should be immediately discontinued and not readministered. 5.9 Hematopoietic Complications Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. There have been a number of reports suggesting a relationship between phenytoin and the development of lymphadenopathy (local or generalized) including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease. Although a cause and effect relationship has not been established, the occurrence of lymphadenopathy indicates the need to differentiate such a condition from other types of lymph node pathology. Lymph node involvement may occur with or without symptoms and signs of DRESS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ]. In all cases of lymphadenopathy, follow-up observation for an extended period is indicated and every effort should be made to achieve seizure control using alternative antiepileptic drugs. 5.10 Effects on Vitamin D and Bone The chronic use of phenytoin in patients with epilepsy has been associated with decreased bone mineral density (osteopenia, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia) and bone fractures. Phenytoin induces hepatic metabolizing enzymes. This may enhance the metabolism of vitamin D and decrease vitamin D levels, which may lead to vitamin D deficiency, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia. Consideration should be given to screening with bone-related laboratory and radiological tests as appropriate and initiating treatment plans according to established guidelines. 5.11 Renal or Hepatic Impairment, or Hypoalbuminemia Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 5.12 Exacerbation of Porphyria In view of isolated reports associating phenytoin with exacerbation of porphyria, caution should be exercised in using this medication in patients suffering from this disease. 5.13 Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn Phenytoin may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. Increased frequencies of major malformations (such as orofacial clefts and cardiac defects), and abnormalities characteristic of fetal hydantoin syndrome, including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits, have been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma. A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. 5.14 Hyperglycemia Hyperglycemia, resulting from the drug's inhibitory effects on insulin release, has been reported. Phenytoin may also raise the serum glucose level in diabetic patients. 5.15 Serum Phenytoin Levels above Therapeutic Range Serum levels of phenytoin sustained above the therapeutic range may produce confusional states referred to as \"delirium,\" \"psychosis,\" or \"encephalopathy,\" or rarely irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and/or cerebellar atrophy. Accordingly, at the first sign of acute toxicity, serum levels should be immediately checked. Dose reduction of phenytoin therapy is indicated if serum levels are excessive; if symptoms persist, termination is recommended."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: Withdrawal Precipitated Seizure, Status Epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Suicidal Behavior and Ideation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Serious Dermatologic Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)/Multiorgan Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Cardiac Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Hepatic Injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Hematopoietic Complications [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Effects on Vitamin D and Bone [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] Exacerbation of Porphyria [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] Teratogenicity and Other Harm to the Newborn [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] Hyperglycemia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] The following adverse reactions associated with the use of phenytoin were identified in clinical studies or postmarketing reports. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Body as a Whole: Allergic reactions in the form of rash and rarely more serious forms and DRESS have been observed as has angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.7 )]. Anaphylaxis has also been reported. There have also been reports of coarsening of facial features, systemic lupus erythematosus, periarteritis nodosa, and immunoglobulin abnormalities. Digestive System: Acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, liver damage, nausea, vomiting, constipation, enlargement of the lips, and gingival hyperplasia. Hematologic and Lymphatic System: Hematopoietic complications, some fatal, have occasionally been reported in association with administration of phenytoin. These have included thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, granulocytopenia, agranulocytosis, and pancytopenia with or without bone marrow suppression. While macrocytosis and megaloblastic anemia have occurred, these conditions usually respond to folic acid therapy. Lymphadenopathy including benign lymph node hyperplasia, pseudolymphoma, lymphoma, and Hodgkin's disease have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ]. Laboratory Test Abnormality: Phenytoin may decrease serum concentrations of thyroid hormone (T4 and T3), sometimes with an accompanying increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), but usually in the absence of clinical hypothyroidism. Phenytoin may also produce lower than normal values for dexamethasone or metyrapone tests. Phenytoin may cause increased serum levels of glucose [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ], alkaline phosphatase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Nervous System: The most common adverse reactions encountered with phenytoin therapy are nervous system reactions and are usually dose-related. Reactions include nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion. Dizziness, vertigo, insomnia, transient nervousness, motor twitchings, paresthesias, and headaches have also been observed. There have also been rare reports of phenytoin-induced dyskinesias, including chorea, dystonia, tremor and asterixis, similar to those induced by phenothiazine and other neuroleptic drugs. Cerebellar atrophy has been reported, and appears more likely in settings of elevated phenytoin levels and/or long-term phenytoin use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ]. A predominantly sensory peripheral polyneuropathy has been observed in patients receiving long-term phenytoin therapy. Skin and Appendages: Dermatological manifestations sometimes accompanied by fever have included scarlatiniform or morbilliform rashes. A morbilliform rash (measles-like) is the most common; other types of dermatitis are seen more rarely. Other more serious forms which may be fatal have included bullous, exfoliative or purpuric dermatitis, acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. There have also been reports of hypertrichosis and urticaria. Special Senses: Altered taste sensation including metallic taste. Urogenital: Peyronie's disease The most common adverse reactions are nervous system reactions, including nystagmus, ataxia, slurred speech, decreased coordination, somnolence, and mental confusion.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Phenytoin is extensively bound to plasma proteins and is prone to competitive displacement. Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19 and is particularly susceptible to inhibitory drug interactions because it is subject to saturable metabolism. Inhibition of metabolism may produce significant increases in circulating phenytoin concentrations and enhance the risk of drug toxicity. Monitoring of phenytoin serum levels is recommended when a drug interaction is suspected. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes. Multiple drug interactions because of extensive plasma protein binding, saturable metabolism and potent induction of hepatic enzymes (7.1 , 7.2) . 7.1 Drugs that Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Table 2 includes commonly occurring drug interactions that affect phenytoin concentrations. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual prescribing information from relevant drugs should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of these agents in patients on phenytoin therapy may require an adjustment of the phenytoin dose to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 2: Drugs That Affect Phenytoin Concentrations Interacting Agent Examples Drugs that may increase phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Ethosuximide, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, methsuximide, topiramate Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, miconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Capecitabine, fluorouracil Antidepressants Fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline Gastric acid reducing agents H 2 antagonists (cimetidine), omeprazole Sulfonamides Sulfamethizole, sulfaphenazole, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim Other Acute alcohol intake, amiodarone, chloramphenicol, chlordiazepoxide, disulfiram, estrogen, fluvastatin, isoniazid, methylphenidate, phenothiazines, salicylates, ticlopidine, tolbutamide, trazodone, warfarin Drugs that may decrease phenytoin serum levels Antacids Antacids may affect absorption of phenytoin. Calcium carbonate, aluminum hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide Prevention or Management: Phenytoin and antacids should not be taken at the same time of day Antineoplastic agents (usually in combination) Bleomycin, carboplatin, cisplatin, doxorubicin, methotrexate Antiviral agents Fosamprenavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir Antiepileptic drugs Carbamazepine, vigabatrin Other Chronic alcohol abuse, diazepam, diazoxide, folic acid, reserpine, rifampin, St. John's wort The induction potency of St. John's wort may vary widely based on preparation. , sucralfate, theophylline Drugs that may either increase or decrease phenytoin serum levels Antiepileptic drugs Phenobarbital, valproate sodium Valproate sodium and valproic acid are similar medications. The term valproate has been used to represent these medications. , valproic acid 7.2 Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Table 3 includes commonly occurring drug interactions affected by phenytoin. However, this list is not intended to be inclusive or comprehensive. Individual drug package inserts should be consulted. The addition or withdrawal of phenytoin during concomitant therapy with these agents may require adjustment of the dose of these agents to achieve optimal clinical outcome. Table 3: Drugs Affected by Phenytoin Interacting Agent Examples Drugs whose efficacy is impaired by phenytoin Azoles Fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole Antineoplastic agents Irinotecan, paclitaxel, teniposide Delavirdine Phenytoin can substantially reduce the concentrations of delavirdine. This can lead to loss of virologic response and possible resistance [see Contraindications (4) ]. Neuromuscular blocking agents Cisatracurium, pancuronium, rocuronium and vecuronium: resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has occurred in patients chronically administered phenytoin. Whether or not phenytoin has the same effect on other non-depolarizing agents is unknown. Prevention or Management: Patients should be monitored closely for more rapid recovery from neuromuscular blockade than expected, and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Warfarin Increased and decreased PT/INR responses have been reported when phenytoin is coadministered with warfarin Other Corticosteroids, doxycycline, estrogens, furosemide, oral contraceptives, paroxetine, quinidine, rifampin, sertraline, theophylline, and vitamin D Drugs whose level is decreased by phenytoin Anticoagulants Apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban Antiepileptic drugs The effect of phenytoin on phenobarbital, valproic acid and sodium valproate serum levels is unpredictable Carbamazepine, felbamate, lacosamide, lamotrigine, topiramate, oxcarbazepine Antilipidemic agents Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin Antiplatelets Ticagrelor Antiviral agents Efavirenz, lopinavir/ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir Fosamprenavir: phenytoin when given with fosamprenavir alone may decrease the concentration of amprenavir, the active metabolite. Phenytoin when given with the combination of fosamprenavir and ritonavir may increase the concentration of amprenavir Calcium channel blockers Nifedipine, nimodipine, nisoldipine, verapamil Other Albendazole (decreases active metabolite), chlorpropamide, clozapine, cyclosporine, digoxin, disopyramide, folic acid, methadone, mexiletine, praziquantel, quetiapine 7.3 Hyperammonemia with Concomitant Use of Valproate Concomitant administration of phenytoin and valproate has been associated with an increased risk of valproate-associated hyperammonemia. Patients treated concomitantly with these two drugs should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hyperammonemia. 7.4 Drug Enteral Feeding/Nutritional Preparations Interaction Literature reports suggest that patients who have received enteral feeding preparations and/or related nutritional supplements have lower than expected phenytoin serum levels. It is therefore suggested that phenytoin not be administered concomitantly with an enteral feeding preparation. More frequent serum phenytoin level monitoring may be necessary in these patients. 7.5 Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Care should be taken when using immunoanalytical methods to measure serum phenytoin concentrations."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Prenatal exposure may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. (5.13 , 8.1) Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia: Monitor unbound phenytoin concentrations in these patients (8.6) . 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), such as phenytoin, during pregnancy. Physicians are advised to recommend that pregnant patients taking phenytoin enroll in the North American Antiepileptic Drug (NAAED) Pregnancy Registry. This can be done by calling the tollfree number 1-888-233-2334, and must be done by patients themselves. Information on the registry can also be found at the website http://www.aedpregnancyregistry.org/ . Risk Summary In humans, prenatal exposure to phenytoin may increase the risks for congenital malformations and other adverse developmental outcomes. Prenatal phenytoin exposure is associated with an increased incidence of major malformations, including orofacial clefts and cardiac defects. In addition, the fetal hydantoin syndrome, a pattern of abnormalities including dysmorphic skull and facial features, nail and digit hypoplasia, growth abnormalities (including microcephaly), and cognitive deficits has been reported among children born to epileptic women who took phenytoin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy [see Data]. There have been several reported cases of malignancies, including neuroblastoma, in children whose mothers received phenytoin during pregnancy. Administration of phenytoin to pregnant animals resulted in an increased incidence of fetal malformations and other manifestations of developmental toxicity (including embryofetal death, growth impairment, and behavioral abnormalities) in multiple species at clinically relevant doses [see Data]. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and of miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal risk An increase in seizure frequency may occur during pregnancy because of altered phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Periodic measurement of serum phenytoin concentrations may be valuable in the management of pregnant women as a guide to appropriate adjustment of dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.4 , 2.8) ]. However, postpartum restoration of the original dosage will probably be indicated [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Fetal/Neonatal Adverse Reactions A potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder related to decreased levels of vitamin K-dependent clotting factors may occur in newborns exposed to phenytoin in utero . This drug-induced condition can be prevented with vitamin K administration to the mother before delivery and to the neonate after birth. Data Human Data Meta-analyses using data from published observational studies and registries have estimated an approximately 2.4-fold increased risk for any major malformation in children with prenatal phenytoin exposure compared to controls. An increased risk of heart defects, facial clefts, and digital hypoplasia has been reported. The fetal hydantoin syndrome is a pattern of congenital anomalies including craniofacial anomalies, nail and digital hypoplasia, prenatal-onset growth deficiency, and neurodevelopmental deficiencies. Animal Data Administration of phenytoin to pregnant rats, rabbits, and mice during organogenesis resulted in embryofetal death, fetal malformations, and decreased fetal growth. Malformations (including craniofacial, cardiovascular, neural, limb, and digit abnormalities) were observed in rats, rabbits, and mice at doses as low as 100 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 12.5 mg/kg, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Phenytoin is secreted in human milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for phenytoin and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from phenytoin or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use Initially, 5 mg/kg/day in two or three equally divided doses, with subsequent dosage individualized to a maximum of 300 mg daily. A recommended daily maintenance dosage is usually 4 mg/kg to 8 mg/kg. Children over 6 years and adolescents may require the minimum adult dosage (300 mg/day) [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment or Hypoalbuminemia The liver is the chief site of biotransformation of phenytoin; patients with impaired liver function, elderly patients, or those who are gravely ill may show early signs of toxicity. Because the fraction of unbound phenytoin is increased in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia, the monitoring of phenytoin serum levels should be based on the unbound fraction in those patients. 8.7 Use in Patients with Decreased CYP2C9 Function Patients who are intermediate or poor metabolizers of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2, *3/*3) may exhibit increased phenytoin serum concentrations compared to patients who are normal metabolizers (e.g., *1/*1). Thus, patients who are known to be intermediate or poor metabolizers may ultimately require lower doses of phenytoin to maintain similar steady-state concentrations compared to normal metabolizers. If early signs of dose-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity develop, serum concentrations should be checked immediately [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.5) ]."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE The lethal dose in pediatric patients is not known. The lethal dose in adults is estimated to be 2 grams to 5 grams. The initial symptoms are nystagmus, ataxia, and dysarthria. Other signs are tremor, hyperreflexia, lethargy, slurred speech, blurred vision, nausea, and vomiting. The patient may become comatose and hypotensive. Bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Death is caused by respiratory and circulatory depression. There are marked variations among individuals with respect to phenytoin serum levels where toxicity may occur. Nystagmus, on lateral gaze, usually appears at 20 mcg/mL, ataxia at 30 mcg/mL, dysarthria and lethargy appear when the serum concentration is over 40 mcg/mL, but as high a concentration as 50 mcg/mL has been reported without evidence of toxicity. As much as 25 times the therapeutic dose has been taken to result in a serum concentration over 100 mcg/mL with complete recovery. Irreversible cerebellar dysfunction and atrophy have been reported. Treatment: Treatment is nonspecific since there is no known antidote. The adequacy of the respiratory and circulatory systems should be carefully observed and appropriate supportive measures employed. Hemodialysis can be considered since phenytoin is not completely bound to plasma proteins. Total exchange transfusion has been used in the treatment of severe intoxication in pediatric patients. In acute overdosage the possibility of other CNS depressants, including alcohol, should be borne in mind."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The precise mechanism by which phenytoin exerts its therapeutic effect has not been established but is thought to involve the voltage-dependent blockade of membrane sodium channels resulting in a reduction in sustained high-frequency neuronal discharges. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption For phenytoin oral suspension, peak levels occur 1\u00bd to 3 hours after administration. Steady-state therapeutic levels are achieved at least 7 to 10 days (5 to 7 half-lives) after initiation of therapy with recommended doses of 300 mg/day. When serum level determinations are necessary, they should be obtained at least 5 to 7 half-lives after treatment initiation, dosage change, or addition or subtraction of another drug to the regimen so that equilibrium or steady-state will have been achieved. Distribution Phenytoin is extensively bound to serum plasma proteins. Elimination The plasma half-life in man after oral administration of phenytoin averages 22 hours, with a range of 7 to 42 hours. Metabolism Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Because phenytoin is hydroxylated in the liver by an enzyme system which is saturable at high serum levels, small incremental doses may increase the half-life and produce very substantial increases in serum levels, when these are in the upper range. The steady-state level may be disproportionately increased, with resultant intoxication, from an increase in dosage of 10% or more. In most patients maintained at a steady dosage, stable phenytoin serum levels are achieved. There may be wide interpatient variability in phenytoin serum levels with equivalent dosages. Patients with unusually low levels may be noncompliant or hypermetabolizers of phenytoin. Unusually high levels result from liver disease, variant CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 alleles, or drug interactions which result in metabolic interference. The patient with large variations in phenytoin serum levels, despite standard doses, presents a difficult clinical problem. Serum level determinations in such patients may be particularly helpful. As phenytoin is highly protein bound, free phenytoin levels may be altered in patients whose protein binding characteristics differ from normal. Excretion Most of the drug is excreted in the bile as inactive metabolites which are then reabsorbed from the intestinal tract and excreted in the urine. Urinary excretion of phenytoin and its metabolites occurs partly with glomerular filtration but, more importantly, by tubular secretion. Specific Populations Age: Geriatric Population: Phenytoin clearance tends to decrease with increasing age (20% less in patients over 70 years of age relative to that in patients 20 to 30 years of age). Since phenytoin clearance is decreased slightly in elderly patients, lower or less frequent dosing may be required [see Dosage and Administration (2.7) ]. Sex/Race: Gender and race have no significant impact on phenytoin pharmacokinetics. Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Increased fraction of unbound phenytoin in patients with renal or hepatic disease, or in those with hypoalbuminemia has been reported. Pregnancy: It has been reported in the literature that the plasma clearance of phenytoin generally increased during pregnancy, reached a peak in the third trimester and returned to the level of pre-pregnancy after few weeks or months of delivery. Drug Interaction Studies Phenytoin is primarily metabolized by the hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2C9 and to a lesser extent by CYP2C19. Phenytoin is a potent inducer of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2 )]. 12.5 Pharmacogenomics CYP2C9 activity is decreased in individuals with genetic variants such as the CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3 alleles. Carriers of variant alleles, resulting in intermediate (e.g., *1/*3, *2/*2) or poor metabolism (e.g., *2/*3, *3/*3) have decreased clearance of phenytoin. Other decreased or nonfunctional CYP2C9 alleles may also result in decreased clearance of phenytoin (e.g., *5, *6, *8, *11). The prevalence of the CYP2C9 poor metabolizer phenotype is approximately 2 to 3% in the White population, 0.5 to 4% in the Asian population, and <1% in the African American population. The CYP2C9 intermediate phenotype prevalence is approximately 35% in the White population, 24% in the African American population, and 15 to 36% in the Asian population [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]."

Administration Information Advise patients taking phenytoin of the importance of adhering strictly to the prescribed dosage regimen, and of informing the physician of any clinical condition in which it is not possible to take the drug orally as prescribed, e.g., surgery, etc. Instruct patients to use an accurately calibrated measuring device when using this medication to ensure accurate dosing. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs Advise patients not to discontinue use of phenytoin without consulting with their healthcare provider. Phenytoin should normally be gradually withdrawn to reduce the potential for increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Suicidal Ideation and Behavior Counsel patients, their caregivers, and families that AEDs, including phenytoin, may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior and advise them of the need to be alert for the emergence or worsening of symptoms of depression, any unusual changes in mood or behavior, or the emergence of suicidal thoughts, behavior, or thoughts about self-harm. Behaviors of concern should be reported immediately to healthcare providers [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Serious Dermatologic Reactions Advise patients of the early signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous adverse reactions and to report any occurrence immediately to a physician [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Potential Signs of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) and Other Systemic Reactions Advise patients of the early toxic signs and symptoms of potential hematologic, dermatologic, hypersensitivity, or hepatic reactions. These symptoms may include, but are not limited to, fever, sore throat, rash, ulcers in the mouth, easy bruising, lymphadenopathy, facial swelling, and petechial or purpuric hemorrhage, and in the case of liver reactions, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, or jaundice. Advise the patient that, because these signs and symptoms may signal a serious reaction, that they must report any occurrence immediately to a physician. In addition, advise the patient that these signs and symptoms should be reported even if mild or when occurring after extended use [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3 , 5.4 , 5.5 , 5.8 , 5.9) ]. Cardiac Effects Counsel patients that cases of bradycardia and cardiac arrest have been reported, both at recommended phenytoin doses and levels, and in association with phenytoin toxicity. Patients should report cardiac signs or symptoms to their healthcare provider [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) and Overdosage (10) ]. Angioedema Advise patients to discontinue phenytoin oral suspension and seek immediate medical care if they develop signs or symptoms of angioedema, such as facial, perioral, or upper airway swelling [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ]. Effects of Alcohol Use and Other Drugs and Over-the-Counter Drug Interactions Caution patients against the use of other drugs or alcoholic beverages without first seeking their physician's advice [see Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ]. Inform patients that certain over-the-counter medications (e.g., antacids, cimetidine, and omeprazole), vitamins (e.g., folic acid), and herbal supplements (e.g., St. John's wort) can alter their phenytoin levels. Hyperglycemia Advise patients that phenytoin may cause an increase in blood glucose levels [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ]. Gingival Hyperplasia Advise patients of the importance of good dental hygiene in order to minimize the development of gingival hyperplasia and its complications.
