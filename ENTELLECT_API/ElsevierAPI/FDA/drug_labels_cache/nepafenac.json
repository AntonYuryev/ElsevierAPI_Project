      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation ( 5.1 ) Delayed healing ( 5.2 ) Corneal effects including keratitis ( 5.3 ) 5.1 Increased Bleeding Time With some NSAIDs including ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3%, there exists the potential for increased bleeding time due to interference with thrombocyte aggregation. There have been reports that ocularly applied nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may cause increased bleeding of ocular tissues (including hyphema) in conjunction with ocular surgery. It is recommended that ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3% be used with caution in patients with known bleeding tendencies or who are receiving other medications which may prolong bleeding time. 5.2 Delayed Healing Topical NSAIDs including ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3%, may slow or delay healing. Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. 5.3 Corneal Effects Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs including ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3% and should be closely monitored for corneal health. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events, which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk and severity of corneal adverse events. 5.4 Contact Lens Wear ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3% should not be administered while using contact lenses."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Because clinical studies are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical studies of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical studies of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Most common adverse reactions (5% to 10%) are capsular opacity, decreased visual acuity, foreign body sensation, increased intraocular pressure, and sticky sensation.

Increased Bleeding Time [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Delayed Healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Corneal Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] 6.2 Ocular Adverse Reactions The most frequently reported ocular adverse reactions following cataract surgery were capsular opacity, decreased visual acuity, foreign body sensation, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and sticky sensation. These reactions occurred in approximately 5% to 10% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of approximately 1% to 5% included conjunctival edema, corneal edema, dry eye, lid margin crusting, ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia, ocular pain, ocular pruritus, photophobia, tearing, and vitreous detachment. Some of these reactions may be the consequence of the cataract surgical procedure. 6.3 Non-Ocular Adverse Reactions Non-ocular adverse reactions reported at an incidence of 1% to 4% included headache, hypertension, nausea/vomiting, and sinusitis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects. Pregnancy Category C: Reproduction studies performed with nepafenac in rabbits and rats at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity due to nepafenac, despite the induction of maternal toxicity. At this dose, the animal plasma exposure to nepafenac and amfenac was approximately 70 and 630 times human plasma exposure at the recommended human topical ophthalmic dose for rats and 20 and 180 times human plasma exposure for rabbits, respectively. In rats, maternally toxic doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg were associated with dystocia, increased postimplantation loss, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Nepafenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Non-teratogenic Effects Because of the known effects of prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), the use of ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3% during late pregnancy should be avoided. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nepafenac is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3% is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3% in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action After topical ocular dosing, nepafenac penetrates the cornea and is converted by ocular tissue hydrolases to amfenac, a NSAID. Nepafenac and amfenac are thought to inhibit the action of prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase), an enzyme required for prostaglandin production. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Following bilateral topical ocular once-daily dosing of ILEVRO \u00ae 0.3%, the concentrations of nepafenac and amfenac peaked at a median time of 0.5 hour and 0.75 hour, respectively on both Day 1 and Day 4. The mean steady-state C max for nepafenac and for amfenac were 0.847 \u00b1 0.269 ng/mL and 1.13 \u00b1 0.491 ng/mL, respectively. Nepafenac at concentrations up to 3000 ng/mL and amfenac at concentrations up to 1000 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of six specific marker substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). Therefore, drug-drug interactions involving CYP mediated metabolism of concomitantly administered drugs are unlikely."

Topical corticosteroids are also known to slow or delay healing. Concomitant use of topical NSAIDs and topical steroids may increase the potential for healing problems. 5.3 Corneal Effects Use of topical NSAIDs may result in keratitis. In some susceptible patients, continued use of topical NSAIDs may result in epithelial breakdown, corneal thinning, corneal erosion, corneal ulceration, or corneal perforation. These events may be sight threatening. Patients with evidence of corneal epithelial breakdown should immediately discontinue use of topical NSAIDs, including NEVANAC 0.1%, and should be closely monitored for corneal health. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs suggests that patients with complicated ocular surgeries, corneal denervation, corneal epithelial defects, diabetes mellitus, ocular surface diseases (e.g., dry eye syndrome), rheumatoid arthritis, or repeat ocular surgeries within a short period of time may be at increased risk for corneal adverse events, which may become sight threatening. Topical NSAIDs should be used with caution in these patients. Postmarketing experience with topical NSAIDs also suggests that use more than 1 day prior to surgery or use beyond 14 days post-surgery may increase patient risk and severity of corneal adverse events. 5.4 Contact Lens Wear NEVANAC \u00ae 0.1% should not be administered while using contact lenses."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Harrow Eye, LLC at 833-4HARROW(427769) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to the rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The most frequently reported ocular adverse reactions following cataract surgery were capsular opacity, decreased visual acuity, foreign body sensation, increased intraocular pressure (IOP), and sticky sensation. These reactions occurred in approximately 5% to 10% of patients. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring at an incidence of approximately 1% to 5% included conjunctival edema, corneal edema, dry eye, lid margin crusting, ocular discomfort, ocular hyperemia, ocular pain, ocular pruritus, photophobia, tearing, and vitreous detachment. Some of these reactions may be the consequence of the cataract surgical procedure. Non-ocular adverse reactions reported at an incidence of 1% to 4% included headache, hypertension, nausea/vomiting, and sinusitis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C: Reproduction studies performed with nepafenac in rabbits and rats at oral doses up to 10 mg/kg/day have revealed no evidence of teratogenicity due to nepafenac, despite the induction of maternal toxicity. At this dose, the animal plasma exposure to nepafenac and amfenac was approximately 260 and 2400 times human plasma exposure at the recommended human topical ophthalmic dose for rats and 80 and 680 times human plasma exposure for rabbits, respectively. In rats, maternally toxic doses greater than or equal to 10 mg/kg were associated with dystocia, increased post-implantation loss, reduced fetal weights and growth, and reduced fetal survival. Nepafenac has been shown to cross the placental barrier in rats. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, NEVANAC 0.1% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Non-Teratogenic Effects Because of the known effects of prostaglandin biosynthesis inhibiting drugs on the fetal cardiovascular system (closure of the ductus arteriosus), the use of NEVANAC 0.1% during late pregnancy should be avoided. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Nepafenac is excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when NEVANAC 0.1% ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of NEVANAC 0.1% in pediatric patients below the age of 10 years have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action After topical ocular dosing, nepafenac penetrates the cornea and is converted by ocular tissue hydrolases to amfenac, an NSAID. Amfenac is thought to inhibit the action of prostaglandin H synthase (cyclooxygenase), an enzyme required for prostaglandin production. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Low but quantifiable plasma concentrations of nepafenac and amfenac were observed in the majority of subjects 2 and 3 hours post dose, respectively, following bilateral topical ocular 3 times-daily dosing of nepafenac ophthalmic suspension, 0.1%. The mean steady-state C max for nepafenac and for amfenac were 0.310 \u00b1 0.104 ng/mL and 0.422 \u00b1 0.121 ng/mL, respectively, following ocular administration. Nepafenac at concentrations up to 300 ng/mL did not inhibit the in vitro metabolism of 6 specific marker substrates of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4). Therefore, drug-drug interactions involving CYP-mediated metabolism of concomitantly administered drugs are unlikely. Drug-drug interactions mediated by protein binding are also unlikely."

Patients treated with NEVANAC \u00ae 0.1% were less likely to have ocular pain and measurable signs of inflammation (cells and flare) in the early postoperative period through the end of treatment than those treated with its vehicle. For ocular pain in both studies, a significantly higher percentage of patients (approximately 80%) in the nepafenac group reported no ocular pain on the day following cataract surgery (Day 1) compared to those in the vehicle group (approximately 50%). Results from clinical studies indicated that NEVANAC 0.1% has no significant effect upon IOP; however, changes in IOP may occur following cataract surgery."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Slow or Delayed Healing Advise the patient of the possibility that slow or delayed healing may occur while using NSAIDs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Avoiding Contamination of the Product Advise the patient to avoid allowing the tip of the dispensing container to contact the eye or surrounding structures because this could cause the tip to become contaminated by common bacteria known to cause ocular infections. Serious damage to the eye and subsequent loss of vision may result from using contaminated solutions. Use of the same bottle for both eyes is not recommended with topical eye drops that are used in association with surgery. Contact Lens Wear Advise the patient that NEVANAC 0.1% should not be administered while wearing contact lens [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Intercurrent Ocular Conditions Advise the patient that if they develop an intercurrent ocular condition (e.g., trauma, or infection) or have ocular surgery, they should immediately seek their physician\u2019s advice concerning the continued use of the multi-dose container [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Concomitant Topical Ocular Therapy If more than one topical ophthalmic medication is being used, the medicines must be administered at least 5 minutes apart [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Shake Well Before Use Advise the patient to shake the container well [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] ."
