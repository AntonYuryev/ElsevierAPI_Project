      "WARNING: In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Precaution Section Folate doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient\u2019s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered. For use on the order of a licensed healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1-877-921-7873 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Adverse Reactions: Folate: Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate. Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals but generally at levels substantially higher than those contained herein. However, allergic, and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels."

      "PRECAUTIONS Folate doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient\u2019s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered. For use on the order of a licensed healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1-877-921-7873 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS: Finazol\u2122 is indicated for iron deficiency anemia and folate deficiency as in extended convalescence, menorrhagia, pregnancy, puberty, excessive blood loss and advanced age. Also, for conditions in which iron deficiency and vitamin C deficiency occur together, along with a deficient intake or increased need for B-Complex vitamins in chronic and acute illness, as well as cases of metabolic stress, and in convalescence."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: This product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folate may obscure its signs and symptoms."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. Administration of folic acid alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient. Precautions: Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient\u2019s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and / or supplements should be considered. For use on the order of a licensed healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1-877-921-7873 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Drug Interactions: Finazol\u2122 is not recommended for and should not be given to patients receiving levodopa because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine. There is a possibility of increased bleeding due to pyridoxine interaction with anticoagulants (e.g., Aspirin, Heparin or Clopidogrel). Adverse Reactions: Folate : Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Finazol\u2122 after meals may control occasional gastrointestinal disturbances. Finazol\u2122 is best absorbed when taken at bedtime. Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals but generally at levels substantially higher than those contained herein. However, allergic and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels. Iron, even at the usual recommended levels, has been associated with gastrointestinal intolerance in some patients."

When overdoses are ingested by children, severe reactions, including fatalities, have resulted. Finazol\u2122 should be stored beyond the reach of children to prevent against accidental iron poisoning. Treatment: For specific therapy, exchange transfusion and chelating agents should be used. For general management, gastric lavage with sodium bicarbonate solution or milk. Administer intravenous fluids and electrolytes and use oxygen."

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Concept OBTM also supplies important prenatal vitamin minerals in a formulation that was especially designed to supplement the nutritional needs of pregnant women, before, during and after pregnancy. In Concept OBTM, patients receive the balanced support of 14 essential vitamins and minerals, including 1 mg of folic acid. The essential role of iron supplementation for pregnant women has long been recognized. Concept OBTM is unique in that it utilizes two (2) different forms of iron, i.e., Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex (as cell-contracted akagane\u0300ite), making available a total of 85 mg of elemental iron per capsule as follows: Ferrous Fumarate (anhydrous) 130 mg Polysaccharide iron complex (PIC) 92.4 mg Ferrous Fumarate: Provides about 42.5 mg of elemental iron per dose. Ferrous Fumarate is an anhydrous salt of a combination of ferrous iron and fumaric acid, containing 33% of iron per weight. The acute toxicity in experimental animals is low and Ferrous Fumarate is well tolerated clinically. As a ferrous salt, it is more efficiently absorbed in the duodenum. Ferrous Fumarate contrasts very favorably with the availability of the 20% of elemental iron of ferrous sulfate, and the 13% of elemental iron of ferrous gluconate. Polysaccharide Iron Complex: Provides about 42.5 mg elemental iron, as a cell-contracted akagane\u0300ite. It is a product of ferric iron complexed to a low molecular weight polysaccharide. This polysaccharide is produced by the extensive hydrolysis of starch and is a dark brown powder that dissolves in water to form a very dark brown solution, which is virtually odorless and tasteless. The most frequent cause of anemia in pregnant women is iron deficiency. Because of the continuous loss of iron due to monthly menstruation, most women enter pregnancy with less than optimal iron stores. Supplementation of iron must suffice to meet the needs for maternal and fetal erythropoisis, and account for daily maternal gastrointestinal losses and obligate fetal transfer and growth. Iron requirements during pregnancy usually cannot be met with the average diet. (ACOG technical bulletin (1993): Nutrition during Pregnancy. p.4. Number 179-April 1993: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Washington, D.C. 20024-2188). Concept OBTM does not contain calcium, as calcium may inhibit iron absorption because of the binding or conversion of ferrous salts by calcium and other minerals. Calcium salts can always be prescribed separately for women at high nutritional risk, including those who do not eat adequate amounts of dairy products. The recommendation of the National Academy of Sciences Tenth Ed. 1989 National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., suggests the supplementation of 1200 mg of calcium for pregnant and lactating women for the prevention of calcium deficiency. Folic acid is a hematopoetic vitamin and has been used extensively for the prevention of neural tube defects. The need for folic acid in pregnancy, with its increased demands of the fetus, or lactation, is not being met by normal dietary sources. Concept OBTM capsules contain 1 mg of folic acid. Neural tube defects (NTD's) are the most common birth defects that result in infant mortality and serious disability. For women with a previous pregnancy that resulted in a child with a neural tube malformation, the use of 4 mg/d of folic acid has been reported to be effective in preventing a recurrence (MRC Vitamin Study Research Group, 1991). However, earlier studies from the United Kingdom suggested that lower daily doses, for example 0.36 mg, might result in a comparable reduction of a recurrence of NTD's. Since neural tube closure is complete by four weeks following conception, beginning folic acid supplementation after that time is not likely to be of any value. It should be noted that a daily 4 mg dose of folic acid did not prevent all NTD's in the MRC study. Patients should be cautioned that folic acid supplementation does not preclude the need for consideration for prenatal testing for NTD's (ACOG Committee Opinion, Number 120, March 1993: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Washington D.C. 20024-2188). The U.S. Public Health Service has recommended that all women of childbearing age in the United States who are capable of becoming pregnant should consume 0.4 mg of folic acid per day for reducing their risk of having a pregnancy affected with spina bifida or other NTD's (Center of Disease Control, 1992). Recommendation for the use of folic acid to reduce the number of cases of spina bifida and other neural tube defects: MMWR 1992: 41(RR14): 1-7). Concept OBTM has been formulated without the addition of vitamins A, D, E and K. These fat-soluble vitamins can accumulate and lead to birth defects. Supplementation of vitamins A, D, E and K should be based on an individual need assessment. All ConceptTM products include a unique patented source of iron, e.g. Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex (U.S. Patent No: 11/243,043 Pending). An increase in tolerability is observed with the (patented formulation) and is believed to occur as the result of distributing the total iron content in the composition among compounds that NDC 52747-620-30 Concept OBTM Prescription Prenatal Postnatal Vitamin Mineral Capsules 52747620300709 Back side Concept OB LC-10807 Rev 07/2009 provide iron to the patient's blood stream via two different mechanisms. The ferrous salts are readily absorbed in the upper gut, by direct dissolution and absorption of the ferrous iron by the bloodstream. However, the iron available from PIC is absorbed in the lower gut, via an active protein transport mechanism\". The Concept OBTM formulation also supplies additional important prenatal vitamin and minerals, which supplement the nutritional needs of pregnant women, before, during and after pregnancy. Deficiencies of these ingredients are common during pregnancy and lactation. Clinical Studies: Because Ferrous Fumarate is an organic complex, it contains no free ions, either ferric or ferrous. Polysaccharide Iron Complex is clinically non-toxic. Prior studies in rats demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron Complex (PIC), administered as a single oral dose to Sprague Dawley rats did not produce evidence of toxicity at a dosage level of 5000 mg Iron/kg: (An Acute Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with Polysaccharide-Iron Complex. T.N.Merriman, M. Aikman and R.E. Rush, Springborn Laboratories. Inc. Spencerville, Ohio Study No. 3340.1 March - April 1994). Other clinical studies had demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron gives a good hematopoietic response with an almost complete absence of the side effects usually associated with oral iron therapy. Picinni and Ricciotti suggested in 1982, that \"the therapeutic effectiveness of Polysaccharide Iron Complex when compared with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, appears to be as active as the iron fumarate and as well tolerated, however, it exerted a greater influence on the level of hemoglobin and on the number of red cells...\" and that, \"it has been exceptionally well tolerated by all patients\" (Picinni, L.-Ricciotti, M. 1982. Therapeutic effectiveness of an iron-polysaccharide complex in comparison with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemias): PANMINERVA MEDICA-EUROPA MEDICA, Vol. 24, No. 3, pp. 213-220 (July - September 1982). As mentioned above, the patented source of iron used in Concept OBTM (Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex) provides a high level of elemental iron with a low incidence of gastric distress. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, the oral combination of Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex was better tolerated and safer than the oral administration of Ferrous Fumarate alone. The conclusion of this research stated, that the addition of PIC to Ferrous Fumarate surprisingly allows the same concentration of Ferrous Fumarate to be better tolerated than the Ferrous Fumarate alone. INDICATIONS: Concept OBTM is a prenatal supplement designed to improve the nutritional status for women throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period to lactating and non-lactating mothers. Concept OBTM may also be used to improve the nutritional status of women before conception. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Concept OBTM is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms. WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. WARNING: Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient. PRECAUTIONS: General: Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg - 0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of this product have not been established in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: No clinical studies have been performed in patients age 65 and over to determine whether older persons respond differently from younger persons. Dosage should always begin at the low end of the dosage scale and should consider that elderly persons may have decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and or concomitant diseases. Adverse Reactions: Folic Acid: Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Concept OBTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Concept OBTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime. OVERDOSE: Iron: Signs and Symptoms: Iron is toxic. Acute overdosage of iron may cause nausea and vomiting and, in severe cases, cardiovascular collapse and death. Other symptoms include pallor and cyanosis, melena, shock, drowsiness and coma. The estimated overdose of orally ingested iron is 300-mg/kg body weight. When overdoses are ingested by children, severe reactions, including fatalities, have resulted. Concept OBTM should be stored beyond the reach of children to prevent against accidental iron poisoning. Keep this and all other drugs out of the reach of children. Treatment: For specific therapy, exchange transfusion and chelating agents should be used. For general management, perform gastric lavage with sodium bicarbonate solution or milk. Administer intravenous fluids and electrolytes and use oxygen. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Adults (persons over 12 years of age), One (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician. Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Risk of Aluminum Toxicity: For at risk patients (renal failure or those with prolonged therapy), consider periodic monitoring of aluminum levels ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Allergic Reactions: To thiamine may occur ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Hypervitaminosis A : Patients with renal failure or liver disease may be at higher risk ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Decreased Anticoagulant Effect of Warfarin: Monitor INR ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Interferes with Megaloblastic Anemia Diagnosis: Avoid during testing for this disorder ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Risk of Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses: Monitor blood vitamin concentrations ( 5.6 ) \u2022 False Negative Urine Glucose Tests: Due to vitamin C ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Risk of Vitamin E Toxicity: Additional oral and parenteral vitamin E may result in elevated vitamin E blood concentrations in infants ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Low Vitamin A Levels: Monitor vitamin A levels ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Risk of E-Ferol Syndrome: Due to polysorbates ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Aluminum Toxicity INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration in pediatric patients with renal impairment. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solution, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration. To prevent aluminum toxicity periodically monitor aluminum levels with prolonged parenteral administration of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. 5.2 Allergic Reactions to Thiamine Allergic reactions such as urticaria, shortness of breath, wheezing and angioedema have been reported following intravenous administration of thiamine, which is found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. There have been rare reports of anaphylaxis following intravenous doses of thiamine. No fatal anaphylaxis associated with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC has been reported. 5.3. Hypervitaminosis A Hypervitaminosis A, manifested by nausea, vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision has been reported in patients with renal failure receiving 1.5 mg/day retinol and in patients with liver disease. Therefore, supplementation of renal failure patients and patients with liver disease with vitamin A, an ingredient found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, should be undertaken with caution [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 , 8.7 ) ]. Blood levels of Vitamin A should be monitored periodically. 5.4 Decreased Anticoagulant Effect of Warfarin INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains Vitamin K which may decrease the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are on warfarin anticoagulant therapy receiving INFUVITE PEDIATRIC monitor blood levels of prothrombin/INR to determine if dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted. 5.5 Interference with Diagnosis of Megaloblastic Anemia INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains folic acid and cyanocobalamin which can mask serum deficiencies of folic acid and cyanocobalamin in patients with megaloblastic anemia. Avoid the use of INFUVITE PEDIATRICS in patients with suspected or diagnosed megaloblastic anemia prior to blood sampling for the detection of the folic acid and cyanocobalamin deficiencies. 5.6 Potential to Develop Vitamin Deficiencies or Excesses In patients receiving parenteral multivitamins such as with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood vitamin concentrations should be periodically monitored to determine if vitamin deficiencies or excesses are developing. INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may not correct long-standing specific vitamin deficiencies. The administration of additional doses of specific vitamins may be required [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) ]. 5.7 Interference with Urine Glucose Testing INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains vitamin C which is also known as ascorbic acid. Ascorbic acid in the urine may cause false negative urine glucose results. 5.8 Vitamin E Overdose in Infants Receiving Additional Vitamin E Additional vitamin E supplementations of patients receiving INFUVITE PEDIATRIC may result in elevated blood concentrations of vitamin E and potential vitamin E toxicity in infants. Avoid additional oral or parental doses of vitamin E in infants. Daily dose of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC contains adequate concentrations of vitamin E required to achieve normal blood levels of vitamin E. 5.9 Risk of Low Vitamin A Levels Lower vitamin A concentrations may occur after administration of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC due to the adherence of Vitamin A to plastic. Monitor blood vitamin A concentrations periodically. Additional administration of therapeutic doses of vitamin A may be required, especially in low-birth weight infants. 5.10 Risk of E-Ferol Syndrome in Low-Birth Weight Infants E-Ferol syndrome manifested by thrombocytopenia, renal dysfunction, hepatomegaly, cholestasis, ascites, hypotension and metabolic acidosis has been reported in low-birth weight infants following administration of polysorbates which are found in INFUVITE PEDIATRIC. No E-Ferol syndrome associated with INFUVITE PEDIATRIC has been reported."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS A number of interactions between vitamins and drugs have been reported. The following are examples of these types of interactions. Effect of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC on other drugs : \u2022 Antibiotics: Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Bleomycin: Ascorbic acid and riboflavin may reduce the activity of bleomycin ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Levodopa: Pyridoxine may decrease blood levels of levodopa and levodopa efficacy may decrease ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Phenytoin: Folic acid may decrease phenytoin blood levels and increase risk of seizure activity ( 7.1 ) \u2022 Methotrexate: Folic acid may decrease response to methotrexate ( 7.1 ) Effects of other drugs on INFUVITE PEDIATRIC: \u2022 Hydralazine, Isoniazid: Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements ( 7.2 ). \u2022 Phenytoin: May decrease folic acid concentrations ( 7.2 ) 7.1 Drug Interactions Affecting Co-administered Drugs Warfarin : Vitamin K, a component of INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, antagonizes the anticoagulant action of warfarin. In patients who are co-administered warfarin and INFUVITE PEDIATRIC, blood levels of prothrombin/INR should be monitored to determine if dose of warfarin needs to be adjusted [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 ) ]. Antibiotics : Thiamine, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacinamide, and ascorbic acid decrease antibiotic activities of erythromycin, kanamycin, streptomycin, doxycycline, and lincomycin. Bleomycin : Ascorbic acid and riboflavin inactivate bleomycin in vitro , thus the activity of bleomycin may be reduced. Levodopa : Pyridoxine may increase the metabolism of levodopa (decrease blood levels of levodopa) and decrease its efficacy. Phenytoin : Folic acid may increase phenytoin metabolism and lower the serum concentration of phenytoin resulting in increased seizure activity. Methotrexate : Folic acid may decrease a patient\u2019s response to methotrexate therapy. 7.2 Drug Interactions Affecting Vitamin Levels Hydralazine, Isoniazid : Concomitant administration of hydralazine or isoniazid may increase pyridoxine requirements. Phenytoin : Phenytoin may decrease serum folic acid concentrations."

      "DESCRIPTION: Each capsule contains: Ferrous Fumarate (anhydrous) ......191.1 mg Polysaccharide Iron Complex... 135.9 mg (Equivalent to about 125 mg of elemental iron) Vitamin C (from ProAscorb C\u2021)....210 mg Folic Acid .....1 mg Thiamine Mononitrate (B1)...5 mg Riboflavin (B2)....5 mg Niacin (B3) . 20 mg d-Calcium Pantothenate (B5)..7 mg Pyridoxine HCl (B6) ...25 mg Biotin (B7)......300 mcg Cyanocobalamin (B12) .. 10 mcg CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Integra PlusTM is unique in that it utilizes two (2) different forms of iron, i.e., Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex (as cell-contracted akagane\u0300ite), making available a total of 125 mg of elemental iron per capsule as follows: Ferrous Fumarate (anhydrous) 191.1 mg Polysaccharide iron complex (PIC) 135.9 mg Subclinical B-Group vitamin deficiencies have greatly increased in recent years, due to changes in dietetic habits, increase in the use of sugar, and the excessive milling of flour and cereals. With thiamine deficiencies in a healthy populous, it is self-evident that the unwell person is particularly prone to thiamine avitaminosis. This is true of the anemic individual with his/her poor appetite and disturbed digestive functions. Folic acid is best known for its role in megaloblastic anemias. Zinc has been recognized in the nutrition of animals and humans, even though the evidence for an uncomplicated zinc deficiency in humans is limited. Ferrous Fumarate: Provides about 62.5 mg of elemental iron per dose. Ferrous Fumarate is an anhydrous salt of a combination of ferrous iron and fumaric acid, containing 33% of iron per weight. The acute toxicity in experimental animals is low and Ferrous Fumarate is well tolerated clinically. As a ferrous salt, it is more efficiently absorbed in the duodenum. Ferrous Fumarate contrasts very favorably with the availability of the 20% of elemental iron of ferrous sulfate, and the 13% of elemental iron of ferrous gluconate. Polysaccharide Iron Complex: Provides about 62.5 mg elemental iron, as a cell-contracted akagane\u0300ite. It is a product of ferric iron complexed to a low molecular weight polysaccharide. This polysaccharide is produced by the extensive hydrolysis of starch and is a dark brown powder that dissolves in water to form a very dark brown solution, which is virtually odorless and tasteless. Folic Acid: Folic Acid is one of the important hematopoetic agents necessary for proper regeneration of the blood-forming elements and their function. Folic acid is a precursor of a large family of compounds which serve as coenzymes in carbon transfer reactions. These reactions are required for the synthesis of purine and pyrimidine bases, inter-conversion of glycine and serine, biosynthesis of methionine methyl groups and degradation of histidine. Additionally, folic acid increases jejunal glycolytic enzymes and is involved in the desaturation and hydroxylation of long-chain fatty acids in the brain. A deficiency in folic acid results in megaloblastic anemia. All IntegraTM products include a unique patented source of iron, e.g. Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex (U.S. Patent No: 11/243,043 Pending). \"An increase in tolerability is observed with the (patented formulation) and is believed to occur as the result of distributing the total iron content in the composition among compounds that provide iron to the patient's blood stream via two different mechanisms. The ferrous salts are readily absorbed in the upper gut, by direct dissolution and absorption of the ferrous iron by the bloodstream. However, the iron available from PIC is absorbed in the lower gut, via an active protein transport mechanism\". Clinical Studies: Because Ferrous Fumarate is an organic complex, it contains no free ions, either ferric or ferrous. Polysaccharide Iron Complex is clinically non-toxic. Prior studies in rats demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron Complex (PIC), administered as a single oral dose to Sprague Dawley rats did not produce evidence of toxicity at a dosage level of 5000 mg Iron/kg: (An Acute Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with Polysaccharide-Iron Complex. T.N.Merriman, M. Aikman and R.E. Rush, Springborn Laboratories. Inc. Spencerville, Ohio Study No. 3340.1 March - April 1994). Other clinical studies had demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron gives a good hematopoietic response with an almost complete absence of the side effects usually associated with oral iron therapy. Picinni and Ricciotti suggested in 1982, that \"the therapeutic effectiveness of Polysaccharide Iron Complex when compared with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, appears to be as active as the iron fumarate and as well tolerated, however, it exerted a greater influence on the level of hemoglobin and on the number of red cells...\" and that, \"it has been exceptionally well tolerated by all patients\" (Picinni, L.-Ricciotti, M. 1982. Therapeutic effectiveness of an iron-polysaccharide complex in comparison with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemias): PANMINERVA MEDICA-EUROPA MEDICA, Vol. 24, No. 3, pp. 213-220 (July-September 1982). As mentioned above, the patented source of iron used in Integra PlusTM (Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex) provides a high level of elemental iron with a low incidence of gastric distress. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, the oral combination of Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex was better tolerated and safer than the oral administration of Ferrous Fumarate alone. The conclusion of this research stated, that the addition of PIC to Ferrous Fumarate surprisingly allows the same concentration of Ferrous Fumarate to be better tolerated than the Ferrous Fumarate alone. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Integra PlusTM is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms. WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. WARNING: Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment of pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient. PRECAUTIONS: General: Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg - 0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of this product have not been established in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: No clinical studies have been performed in patients age 65 and over to determine whether older persons respond differently from younger persons. Dosage should always begin at the low end of the dosage scale and should consider that elderly persons may have decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function and or concomitant diseases. Adverse Reactions: Folic Acid: Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Integra PlusTM after meals may control occasional G.I. disturbances. Integra PlusTM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime. OVERDOSE: Iron: Signs and Symptoms: Iron is toxic. Acute overdosage of iron may cause nausea and vomiting and, in severe cases, cardiovascular collapse and death. Other symptoms include pallor and cyanosis, melena, shock, drowsiness and coma. The estimated overdose of orally ingested iron is 300-mg/kg body weight. When overdoses are ingested by children, severe reactions, including fatalities, have resulted. Integra PlusTM should be stored beyond the reach of children to prevent against accidental iron poisoning. Keep this and all other drugs out of the reach of children. Treatment: For specific therapy, exchange transfusion and chelating agents should be used. For general management, perform gastric lavage with sodium bicarbonate solution or milk. Administer intravenous fluids and electrolytes and use oxygen. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Adults (persons over 12 years of age), One (1) capsule daily, between meals, or as prescribed by a physician. Do not exceed recommended dosage. Do not administer to children under the age of 12. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness of this product have not been established in pediatric patients.

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS STROVITE \u00ae ONE is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components. Folic Acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12)."
    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "WARNING/PRECAUTIONS Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "Drug Interactions High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hyper-calcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled to disclose all medical conditions, including use of all medications, vitamins and supplements, pregnancy, and breastfeeding. Pediatric Use Not recommended for pediatric use."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: This product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. Administration of folic acid alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient. Precaution Section Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient\u2019s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered. For use on the order of a healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1-877-921-7873 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Drug Interactions: Folitin-Z TM is not recommended for and should not be given to patients receiving levodopa because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine. There is a possibility of increased bleeding due to pyridoxine interaction with anticoagulants (e.g., Aspirin, Heparin, or Clopidogrel). Adverse Reactions: Folic Acid: Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Folitin-Z TM after meals may control occasional gastrointestinal disturbances. Folitin-Z TM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime. Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals but generally at levels substantially higher than those contained herein. However, allergic and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels. Iron, even at the usually recommended levels, has been associated with gastrointestinal intolerance in some patients."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: This product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folic acid may obscure its signs and symptoms."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. Administration of folic acid alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B12 is deficient. Precaution Section Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folic acid to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folic acid may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient\u2019s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered. For use on the order of a healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1-877-921-7873 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Drug Interactions: Ribotin-E TM is not recommended for and should not be given to patients receiving levodopa because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine. There is a possibility of increased bleeding due to pyridoxine interaction with anticoagulants (e.g., Aspirin, Heparin, or Clopidogrel). Adverse Reactions: Folic Acid: Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation)occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Ribotin-E\u2122 after meals may control occasional gastrointestinal disturbances. Ribotin-E\u2122\u200b i s best absorbed when taken at bedtime. Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals but generally at levels substantially higher than those contained herein. However, allergic and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels. Iron, even at the usually recommended levels, has been associated with gastrointestinal intolerance in some patients."

Polysaccharide Iron Complex is clinically non-toxic. Prior studies in rats demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron Complex (PIC), administered as a single oral dose to Sprague Dawley rats did not produce evidence of toxicity at a dosage level of 5000 mg Iron/kg: (An Acute Oral Toxicity Study in Rats with Polysaccharide-Iron Complex. T.N.Merriman, M. Aikman and R.E. Rush, Springborn Laboratories, Inc. Spencerville, Ohio Study No. 3340.1 March - April 1994). Other clinical studies had demonstrated that Polysaccharide Iron gives a good hematopoietic response with an almost complete absence of the side effects usually associated with oral iron therapy. Picinni and Ricciotti suggested in 1982, that \"the therapeutic effectiveness of Polysaccharide Iron Complex when compared with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, appears to be as active as the iron fumarate and as well tolerated, however, it exerted a greater influence on the level of hemoglobin and on the number of red cells...\" and that, \"it has been exceptionally well tolerated by all patients\" (Picinni, L.-Ricciotti, M. 1982. Therapeutic effectiveness of an iron-polysaccharide complex in comparison with iron fumarate in the treatment of iron deficiency anemias): PANMINERVA MEDICA-EUROPA MEDICA, Vol. 24, No. 3, pp. 213-220 (July - September 1982). As mentioned above, the patented source of iron used in Concept DHATM (Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex) provides a high level of elemental iron with a low incidence of gastric distress. CONCLUSION: Based on the results of this study, the oral combination of Ferrous Fumarate and Polysaccharide Iron Complex was better tolerated and safer than the oral administration of Ferrous Fumarate alone. The conclusion of this research stated, that the addition of PIC to Ferrous Fumarate surprisingly allows the same concentration of Ferrous Fumarate to be better tolerated than the Ferrous Fumarate alone. INDICATIONS: Concept DHATM is a prescription prenatal vitamin-mineral preparation containing omega-3 fatty acid supplements designed to supply nutritional supplementation for women throughout pregnancy and during the postnatal period to lactating and non-lactating mothers. Concept DHATM may also be used to improve the nutritional status of women before conception. WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. WARNING: Ingestion of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils per day may have potential antithrombotic effects, including an increased bleeding time and INR (international normalized ratio). DHA should be avoided in patients with inherited or acquired bleeding diatheses, including those taking anticoagulants. WARNING: Folic acid alone is improper therapy in the treatment for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias where Vitamin B12 is deficient. PRECAUTIONS: General: Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg - 0.4 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematological remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive.

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: This product is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its ingredients; also, all iron compounds are contraindicated in patients with hemosiderosis, hemochromatosis, or hemolytic anemias. Pernicious anemia is a contraindication, as folate may obscure its signs and symptoms."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNING: Accidental overdose of iron-containing products is a leading cause of fatal poisoning in children under 6. Keep this product out of reach of children. In case of accidental overdose, call a doctor or poison control center immediately. Administration of folate alone is improper therapy for pernicious anemia and other megaloblastic anemias in which vitamin B 12 is deficient. Precaution Section Folate in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia, since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient\u2019s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered. For use on the order of a healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1-877-921-7873 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Drug Interactions: Foliflex TM is not recommended for and should not be given to patients receiving levodopa because the action of levodopa is antagonized by pyridoxine. There is a possibility of increased bleeding due to pyridoxine interaction with anticoagulants (e.g., Aspirin, Heparin, or Clopidogrel). Adverse Reactions: Folate: Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate. Ferrous Fumarate: Gastrointestinal disturbances (anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, constipation) occur occasionally, but are usually mild and may subside with continuation of therapy. Although the absorption of iron is best when taken between meals, giving Foliflex TM after meals may control occasional gastrointestinal disturbances. Foliflex TM is best absorbed when taken at bedtime. Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals but generally at levels substantially higher than those contained herein. However, allergic and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels. Iron, even at the usually recommended levels, has been associated with gastrointestinal intolerance in some patients."

      "WARNING: In case of accidental overdose, seek professional assistance or contact a Poison Control Center immediately. Precaution Section Folate doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. There is a potential danger in administering folate to patients with undiagnosed anemia since folate may obscure the diagnosis of pernicious anemia by alleviating the hematologic manifestations of the disease while allowing the neurologic complications to progress. This may result in severe nervous system damage before the correct diagnosis is made. Adequate doses of vitamin B12 may prevent, halt, or improve the neurologic changes caused by pernicious anemia. The patient\u2019s medical conditions and consumption of other drugs, herbs, and/or supplements should be considered. For use on the order of a licensed healthcare practitioner. Call your doctor about side effects. To report side effects, call PureTek Corporation at 1-877-921-7873 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Adverse Reactions: Folate: Allergic sensitizations have been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folate. Adverse reactions have been reported with specific vitamins and minerals but generally at levels substantially higher than those contained herein. However, allergic, and idiosyncratic reactions are possible at lower levels."
