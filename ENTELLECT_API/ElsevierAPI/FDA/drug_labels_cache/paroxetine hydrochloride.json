      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue Paroxetine HCL CR and serotonergic agents and initiate supportive measures. ( 5.2 ) Embryofetal Toxicity : May cause fetal harm. Meta-analysis of epidemiological studies have shown increased risk (less than 2-fold) of cardiovascular malformations with exposure during the first trimester.( 5.4 , 8. 1) Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulant drugs may increase risk. ( 5.5 ) Activation of Mania/Hypomania : Screen patients for bipolar disorder. ( 5.6 ) Seizures : Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders. ( 5.8 ) Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles, treated with antidepressants (5.9 ) Sexual Dysfunction: Paroxetine HCL CR may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1,000 patients treated are provided in Table 2. Table 2: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1,000 Patients Treated I ncreases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18 to 24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 years old 1 fewer patient \u226565 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Paroxetine HCL CR, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including Paroxetine HCL CR, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Paroxetine HCL CR in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Paroxetine HCL CR, discontinue Paroxetine HCL CR before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Monitor all patients taking Paroxetine HCL CR for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Paroxetine HCL CR and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Cases of QT interval prolongation have been reported, although causality with Paroxetine HCL CR has not been established. Paroxetine HCL CR should be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval prolongation, patients taking anti-arrhythmic or other medications that may potentially prolong QT interval, or those with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease. The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide. Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias, the use of Paroxetine HCL CR is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on meta-analyses of epidemiological studies, exposure to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the rate of cardiovascular malformations among infants. For women who intend to become pregnant or who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, Paroxetine HCL CR should be initiated only after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. 5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Paroxetine HCL CR, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case\u2011control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio. 5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with Paroxetine HCL CR or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of immediate\u2011release paroxetine hydrochloride, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine\u2011treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active\u2011control and 0.3% of placebo\u2011treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with Paroxetine HCL CR, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [ See Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. Adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.8 Seizures Paroxetine HCL CR has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Paroxetine HCL CR should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder and should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. 5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Paroxetine HCL CR may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Cases of angle-closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine hydrochloride tablets have been reported. Avoid use of antidepressants, including Paroxetine HCL CR, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. 5.10 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Paroxetine HCL CR. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue Paroxetine HCL CR and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 5.11 Reduction of Efficacy of Tamoxifen Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced with concomitant use of paroxetine as a result of paroxetine\u2019s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 and lower blood levels of tamoxifen [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )]. One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. 5.12 Bone Fracture Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk during exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures. There are multiple possible causes for this observation, and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. 5.13 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including Paroxetine HCL CR, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Paroxetine HCL CR and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Apotex Corp. at 1-800-706-5575 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety data for Paroxetine HCL CR is from 11 short-term, placebo\u2011controlled clinical trials including 3 studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 3 studies in patients with panic disorder (PD) (Studies 4, 5, and 6), 1 study in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Study 7), and 4 studies in female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. These 11 trials included 1627 patients treated with Paroxetine HCL CR. Studies 1 and 2 were 12-week studies that enrolled patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 25 mg to 62.5 mg once daily. Study 3 was a 12-week study in patients 60 to 88 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily. Studies 4, 5, and 6 were 10-week studies in patients 19 to 72 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg once daily. Study 7 was a 12-week study that enrolled adult patients who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg once daily. Studies 8, 9, and 10 were 12\u2011week, placebo\u2011controlled trials in female patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Study 11 was a 12-week placebo\u2011controlled trial in patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing) at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with MDD, PD, SAD, and PMDD In pooled studies in patients with MDD, PD and SAD, the most common adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal were: nausea (up to 4% of patients), asthenia, headache, depression, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests (each occurring in up to 2% of patients), and dizziness, somnolence, and diarrhea (each occurring in up to 1% of patients). In pooled studies for PMDD, the most common adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal were: nausea (occurring in up to 6% of patients), asthenia (occurring in up to 5% of patients), somnolence (occurring in up to 4% of patients), insomnia (occurring in approximately 2% of patients); and impaired concentration, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, sweating, tremor, yawn and diarrhea (occurring in less than or equal to 2% of patients).

Adverse Reactions in Patients with PMDD Table 4 displays adverse reactions that occurred (incidence of 5% or more and greater than placebo within at least 1 of the studies) in patients treated with Paroxetine HCL CR in Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11.

Dose Dependent Adverse Reactions Comparison of the incidence of adverse reactions (placebo vs. 12.5 mg Paroxetine HCL CR vs. 25 mg Paroxetine HCL CR) from studies 8, 9, 10 showed the following adverse reactions to be dose-related: Nausea, somnolence, sweating, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, tremor, impaired concentration, yawn, paresthesia, hyperkinesia, and vaginitis. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence. The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction in the Studies 1 and 2 (nonelderly patients with MDD), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are presented in Table 5: Table 5.

Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae. Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions occurred during the clinical studies of Paroxetine HCL CR and are not included elsewhere in the labeling. Reactions are categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse reactions are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Cardiovascular System : Infrequent was postural hypotension. Hemic and Lymphatic System: Rare was thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Infrequent were generalized edema and hypercholesteremia. Nervous System : Infrequent were convulsion, akathisia, and manic reaction. Psychiatric: Infrequent were hallucinations. Skin and Appendages : Frequent was rash; infrequent was urticaria; rare was angioedema and erythema multiforme. Urogenital System: Infrequent was urinary retention; rare was urinary incontinence. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during post approval use of paroxetine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Acute pancreatitis, elevated liver function tests (the most severe cases were deaths due to liver necrosis, and grossly elevated transaminases associated with severe liver dysfunction), Guillain\u2011Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), priapism, syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), prolactinemia and galactorrhea; extrapyramidal symptoms which have included akathisia, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dystonia, hypertonia, trismus; status epilepticus, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, allergic alveolitis, anosmia, hyposmia, anaphylaxis, eclampsia, laryngismus, optic neuritis, porphyria, restless legs syndrome (RLS), ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (including torsade de pointes), hemolytic anemia, events related to impaired hematopoiesis (including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, and agranulocytosis), and vasculitic syndromes (such as Henoch\u2011Sch\u00f6nlein purpura)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein: Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of Paroxetine HCL CR or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted. ( 7 ) Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 as warranted. ( 7 ) Concomitant use with Tamoxifen: Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. ( 5.11 , 7 ) 7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine HCL CR Table 6 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Paroxetine HCL CR. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine HCL CR Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact The concomitant use of SSRIs, including Paroxetine HCL CR, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Paroxetine HCL CR is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Examples selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue Pimozide and Thioridazine Clinical Impact Paroxetine HCL CR should not be used in patients receiving medications that can prolong QT interval and are metabolized by CYP450 2D6 such as thioridazine or pimozide (see Contraindications and Warnings and Precautions ) Intervention Paroxetine HCL CR is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide or thioridazine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Paroxetine HCL CR increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of Paroxetine HCL CR and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Examples Other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John\u2019s Wort Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) Clinical Impact The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with Paroxetine HCL CR may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Intervention Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Examples aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein Clinical Impact Paroxetine HCL CR is highly bound to plasma protein. The concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of Paroxetine HCL CR or other tightly-bound drugs in plasma. Intervention Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of Paroxetine HCL CR or other protein-bound drugs as warranted. Examples warfarin Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Clinical Impact Paroxetine HCL CR is a CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The concomitant use of Paroxetine HCL CR with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the CYP2D6 substrate. Intervention Decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed with concomitant Paroxetine HCL CR use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate may be needed if Paroxetine HCL CR is discontinued. Examples propafenone, flecainide, atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, venlafaxine, risperidone. Tamoxifen Clinical Impact Concomitant use of tamoxifen with Paroxetine HCL CR may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite (endoxifen) and reduced efficacy of tamoxifen Intervention Consider use of an alternative antidepressant little or no CYP2D6 inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir Clinical Impact Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Intervention Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly later in pregnancy, may increase the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, hypotonia, irritability) in the neonate. ( 5.4, 8.1 ) Nursing Mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-researchprograms/ pregnancy registry/antidepressants/. Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Clinical Considerations]. Paroxetine HCL CR is associated with a less than 2-fold increase in cardiovascular malformations when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. While individual epidemiological studies on the association between paroxetine use and cardiovascular malformations have reported inconsistent findings, some meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have identified an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (see Data). There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Paroxetine HCL CR, during pregnancy. There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations). For women who intend to become pregnant or who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should be initiated only after consideration of the other available treatment options. No evidence of treatment related malformations was observed in animal reproduction studies, when paroxetine was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses are approximately 6 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD -75 mg) on an mg/m 2 basis. When paroxetine was administered to female rats during the last trimester of gestation and continued through lactation, there was an increase in the number of pup deaths during the first four days of lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is less than the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis (see Data). The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risks of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of Paroxetine HCL CR in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)]. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Neonates exposed to Paroxetine HCL CR and other SSRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremors, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)]. Data Human Data Published epidemiological studies on the association between first trimester paroxetine use and cardiovascular malformations have reported inconsistent results; however, meta-analyses of population-based cohort studies published between 1996 to 2017 indicate a less than 2-fold increased risk for overall cardiovascular malformations. Specific cardiac malformations identified in two meta-analyses include approximately 2 to 2.5-fold increased risk for right ventricular outflow tract defects. One meta-analysis also identified an increased risk (less than 2-fold) for bulbus cordis anomalies and anomalies of cardiac septal closure, and an increased risk for atrial septal defects (pooled OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.14 to 4.97). Important limitations of the studies included in these meta-analyses include potential confounding by indication, depression severity, and potential exposure misclassification. Exposure to SSRIs, particularly later in pregnancy, may have an increased risk for PPHN. PPHN occurs in 1 to 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Animal Data Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 6 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD \u2013 75 mg) on an mg/m 2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of malformations. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is less than the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. The no\u2011effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from the published literature report the presence of paroxetine in human milk (see Data). There are reports of agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to paroxetine through breast milk (see Clinical Considerations). There are no data on the effects of paroxetine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Paroxetine HCL CR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Paroxetine HCL CR or the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Paroxetine HCL CR should be monitored for agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain. Data Published literature suggests the presence of paroxetine in human milk with relative infant doses ranging between 0.4% to 2.2%, and a milk: plasma ratio of <1. No significant amounts were detected in the plasma of infants after breastfeeding. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Male Based on findings from clinical studies, paroxetine may affect sperm quality which may impair fertility; it is not known if this effect is reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Three placebo-controlled trials in 752 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with immediate-release paroxetine, and effectiveness was not established in pediatric patients. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride and at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self-harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation. Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain. 8.5 Geriatric Use SSRIs and SNRIs, including Paroxetine HCL CR, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )]. In premarketing clinical trials with immediate\u2011release paroxetine hydrochloride, 17% of paroxetine treated patients (approximately 700) were 65 years or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; however, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. The initial dosage of Paroxetine HCL CR, should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tablets of Paroxetine HCL CR contain a degradable polymeric matrix designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours. In addition to controlling the rate of drug release in vivo , an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until tablets of Paroxetine HCL CR have left the stomach. Paroxetine extended-release tablets are completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of Paroxetine HCL CR at 4 dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg), paroxetine C max and AUC 0-inf increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate\u2011release formulations). Mean C max and AUC 0-inf values at these doses were 2, 5.5, 9, and 12.5 ng/mL, and 121, 261, 338, and 540 ng\u00b7hr. /mL, respectively. T max was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post\u2011dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate\u2011release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg Paroxetine HCL CR is not affected by food. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of Paroxetine HCL CR (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg). During repeated administration of Paroxetine HCL CR (25 mg once daily), steady state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate\u2011release formulations). In a repeat\u2011dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received Paroxetine HCL CR (25 mg daily), mean steady state C max , C min , and AUC 0-24 values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 550 ng\u00b7hr./mL, respectively. Based on studies using immediate\u2011release formulations, steady\u2011state drug exposure based on AUC 0-24 was several\u2011fold greater than would have been predicted from single\u2011dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. In steady\u2011state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate\u2011release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway (Figure 3). Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug\u2011drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30 mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10\u2011day post\u2011dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10\u2011day post\u2011dosing period. The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of Paroxetine HCL CR. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Figure 1. Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs (log scale) Figure 2. Impact of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine Theophylline : Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with immediate\u2011release paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady\u2011state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Paroxetine\u2019s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not expected to be of clinical significance.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT)."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tablets of Paroxetine HCL CR contain a degradable polymeric matrix designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours. In addition to controlling the rate of drug release in vivo , an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until tablets of Paroxetine HCL CR have left the stomach. Paroxetine extended-release tablets are completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of Paroxetine HCL CR at 4 dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg), paroxetine C max and AUC 0-inf increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate\u2011release formulations). Mean C max and AUC 0-inf values at these doses were 2, 5.5, 9, and 12.5 ng/mL, and 121, 261, 338, and 540 ng\u00b7hr. /mL, respectively. T max was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post\u2011dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate\u2011release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg Paroxetine HCL CR is not affected by food. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of Paroxetine HCL CR (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg). During repeated administration of Paroxetine HCL CR (25 mg once daily), steady state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate\u2011release formulations). In a repeat\u2011dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received Paroxetine HCL CR (25 mg daily), mean steady state C max , C min , and AUC 0-24 values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 550 ng\u00b7hr./mL, respectively. Based on studies using immediate\u2011release formulations, steady\u2011state drug exposure based on AUC 0-24 was several\u2011fold greater than would have been predicted from single\u2011dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. In steady\u2011state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate\u2011release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway (Figure 3). Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug\u2011drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30 mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10\u2011day post\u2011dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10\u2011day post\u2011dosing period. The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of Paroxetine HCL CR. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Figure 1. Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs (log scale) Figure 2. Impact of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine Theophylline : Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with immediate\u2011release paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady\u2011state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two\u2011year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are up to approximately 1.6 (mouse) and 2.5 (rat) times the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high\u2011dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low\u2011, middle\u2011, and high\u2011dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose\u2011related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug\u2011related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 in vitro and 2 in vivo assays that included the following: Bacterial mutation assay, mouse lymphoma mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats. Impairment of Fertility A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is approximately twice the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 3 times the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of Paroxetine HCL CR as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) was established in two 12\u2011week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo\u2011controlled, flexible dose studies with Paroxetine HCL CR (Study 1 and Study 2) in adult patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)\u2011IV criteria for MDD. Study 1 and 2 included patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine HCL CR doses of 25 to 62.5 mg/day (N= 212) or placebo (N= 211) once daily compared to immediate-release paroxetine 20 to 50 mg (N=217). A third 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo\u2011controlled, flexible dose study with Paroxetine HCL CR (Study 3) included elderly patients, ranging in age from 60 to 88 years old and used Paroxetine HCL CR doses of 12.5 to 50 mg/day (N=104 ) or placebo (N=109) once daily compared to immediate-release paroxetine 10 to 40 mg (N=106). In all three studies, Paroxetine HCL CR was statistically superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms as measured by the following: the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score at Week 12, the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depressed Mood item score at Week 12, and the mean change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)\u2013Severity of Illness score. Long-term efficacy of paroxetine for treatment of MDD in outpatients was established with one randomized withdrawal study with immediate-release paroxetine. Patients who responded to immediate\u2011release paroxetine (HDRS total score <8) during an initial 8\u2011week open\u2011label treatment phase were then randomized to continue immediate\u2011release paroxetine or placebo, for up to 1 year. Patients treated with immediate\u2011release paroxetine demonstrated a statistically significant lower relapse rate during the withdrawal phase (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients. 14.2 Panic Disorder The effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was evaluated in three 10\u2011week, multicenter, flexible\u2011dose studies (Studies 4, 5, and 6) comparing Paroxetine HCL CR (12.5 to 75 mg daily) to placebo in adult outpatients 19 to 72 years of age who met panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) criteria according to DSM\u2011IV. These trials were assessed on the basis of their outcomes on 3 variables: (1) the proportions of patients free of full panic attacks at Week 10; (2) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median number of full panic attacks; and (3) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median Clinical Global Impression Severity score. For Studies 4 and 5, Paroxetine HCL CR was superior to placebo on 2 of these 3 variables. Study 6 failed to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant difference between Paroxetine HCL CR and placebo on any of these variables. For all 3 studies, the mean dose of Paroxetine HCL CR for completers at Week 10 was approximately 50 mg/day. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. Long\u2011term maintenance effects of paroxetine in patients with PD were demonstrated in a randomized-withdrawal study using immediate\u2011release paroxetine. Patients who were responders during a 10\u2011week, double\u2011blind trial (followed by a 3-month double-blind maintenance phase) of immediate\u2011release paroxetine were re-randomized to continue immediate\u2011release paroxetine or placebo in a 3\u2011month, double\u2011blind withdrawal phase. Patients randomized to immediate-release paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients. 14.3 Social Anxiety Disorder The efficacy of Paroxetine HCL CR as a treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD) was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of immediate\u2011release paroxetine in the treatment of SAD. In addition, the effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR in the treatment of SAD was demonstrated in one 12\u2011week, multicenter, double\u2011blind, flexible\u2011dose, placebo\u2011controlled study of adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of SAD by DSM\u2011IV criteria (Study 7). In Study 7, the effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR (12.5 to 37.5 mg daily) compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of (1) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score at Week 12 and (2) the proportion of responders who scored 1 or 2 (very much improved or much improved) on the CGI Global Improvement score at Week 12. In Study 7, Paroxetine HCL CR demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the change on LSAS total score at Week 12 and the CGI Improvement responder criterion at Week 12. For patients who completed the trial, 64% of patients treated with Paroxetine HCL CR compared to 35% of patients treated with placebo were CGI Improvement responders at Week 12. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender. Subgroup analyses of studies utilizing the immediate\u2011release formulation of paroxetine generally did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender. 14.4 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder The effectiveness of Paroxetine HCL CR for the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo\u2011controlled trials in female patients ages 18 to 46 (Studies 8 and 9 [N=672]). Patients in these trials met DSM\u2011IV criteria for PMDD. Of 1,030 patients including Study 10, who were treated with daily doses of Paroxetine HCL CR 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles, the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 \u00b1 7 years. Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of Paroxetine HCL CR in combination with systemic (including oral) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown. The VAS score is a patient\u2011rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM\u2011IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms associated with PMDD. In Studies 8 and 9, 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine HCL CR were statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to Month 3 on the luteal phase VAS score. In an additional study employing luteal phase dosing (Study 11), patients (N = 366) were treated for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses with 12.5 or 25 mg/day of Paroxetine HCL CR or placebo for a period of 3 months. In this trial,12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine HCL CR, as luteal phase dosing, was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to luteal phase VAS score at Month 3. There is insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11."

( 2.3 ) Elderly patients, patients with severe renal impairment or severe hepatic impairment: Starting dosage is 10 mg daily. Maximum dosage is 40 mg daily. ( 2.4 ) When discontinuing paroxetine, reduce dosage gradually. ( 2.6 , 5.7 ) 2.1 Administration Information Administer paroxetine tablets, USP as a single daily dose in the morning, with or without food. 2.2 Recommended Dosage for MDD, OCD, PD, and PTSD The recommended starting dosages and maximum dosages of paroxetine in patients with MDD, OCD, PD, and PTSD are presented in Table 1 . In patients with an inadequate response, increase dosage in increments of 10 mg per day at intervals of at least 1 week, depending on tolerability. Table 1: Recommended Daily Dosage of Paroxetine in Patients with MDD, OCD, PD, and PTSD Indication Starting Dose Maximum Dose MDD 20 mg 50 mg OCD 20 mg 60 mg PD 10 mg 60 mg PTSD 20 mg 50 mg 2.3 Recommended Dosage for SAD and GAD SAD The starting and recommended dosage in patients with SAD is 20 mg daily. In clinical trials the effectiveness of paroxetine was demonstrated in patients dosed in a range of 20 mg to 60 mg daily. While the safety of paroxetine has been evaluated in patients with SAD at doses up to 60 mg daily, available information does not suggest any additional benefit for doses above 20 mg daily [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )]. GAD The starting and recommended dosage in patients with GAD is 20 mg daily. In clinical trials the effectiveness of paroxetine in GAD was demonstrated in patients dosed in a range of 20 mg to 50 mg daily. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest a greater benefit to doses higher than 20 mg daily [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . In patients with an inadequate response, increase dosage in increments of 10 mg per day at intervals of at least 1 week, depending on tolerability. 2.4 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Paroxetine Prior to initiating treatment with paroxetine or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Elderly Patients, Patients with Severe Renal Impairment, and Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment The recommended initial dosage is 10 mg per day for elderly patients, patients with severe renal impairment, and patients with severe hepatic impairment. Dosage should not exceed 40 mg/day. 2.6 Switching Patients to or From a Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitor (MAOI) At least 14 days must elapse between discontinuation of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and initiation of paroxetine. In addition, at least 14 days must elapse after stopping paroxetine before starting an MAOI antidepressant [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.7 Discontinuation of Treatment With Paroxetine Adverse reactions may occur upon discontinuation of paroxetine [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. Gradually reduce the dosage rather than stopping paroxetine abruptly whenever possible."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRI, SNRI, triptans), but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue paroxetine and initiate supportive measures. ( 5.2 ) Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity: Can cause fetal and neonatal harm. Increased risk of cardiovascular malformations with exposure during the first trimester. Exposure in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) Increased Risk of Bleeding : Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulant drugs may increase risk. ( 5.5 ) Activation of Mania/Hypomania : Screen patients for bipolar disorder. ( 5.6 ) Seizures : Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders. ( 5.8 ) Angle-Closure Glaucoma : Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants. ( 5.9 ) Sexual Dysfunction: paroxetine may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2 . Table 2. Risk Differences of the Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo < 18 years old 14 additional patients 18 to 24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 years old 1 fewer patient \u2265 65 years old 6 fewer patients Paroxetine is not approved for use in pediatric patients. It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing paroxetine, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome SSRIs, including paroxetine, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines and St. John\u2019s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of paroxetine with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate paroxetine in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking paroxetine discontinue paroxetine before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Monitor all patients taking paroxetine for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with paroxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of paroxetine with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide. Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias, the use of paroxetine is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.4 Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity Paroxetine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations. Exposure to paroxetine in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPNH) and/or neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. If paroxetine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including paroxetine, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio. 5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with paroxetine or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of paroxetine, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with paroxetine, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. During clinical trials of GAD and PTSD, gradual decreases in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals followed by 1 week at 20 mg/day was used before treatment was discontinued. The following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for paroxetine and were at least twice that reported for placebo: Abnormal dreams, paresthesia, and dizziness Adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.8 Seizures Paroxetine tablets, USP have not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. During clinical studies, seizures occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with paroxetine. Paroxetine should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder. Discontinue paroxetine in any patient who develops seizures. 5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including paroxetine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Cases of angle-closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine have been reported. Avoid use of antidepressants, including paroxetine in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. 5.10 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including paroxetine. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue paroxetine and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 5.11 Reduction of Efficacy of Tamoxifen Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced with concomitant use of paroxetine as a result of paroxetine\u2019s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 and lower blood levels of tamoxifen [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. 5.12 Bone Fracture Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk during exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures. There are multiple possible causes for this observation, and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. 5.13 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including paroxetine, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of paroxetine and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment."

PD In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg in the treatment of PD, the following adverse reactions were shown to be dose-dependent: asthenia, dry mouth, anxiety, libido decreased, tremor, and abnormal ejaculation. SAD In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg in the treatment of SAD, for most of the adverse reactions, there was no clear relationship between adverse reactions and the dose of paroxetine to which patients were assigned. GAD In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 20 mg and 40 mg in the treatment of GAD, the following adverse reactions were shown to be dose-dependent: asthenia, constipation, and abnormal ejaculation. PTSD In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 20 mg and 40 mg in the treatment of PTSD, the following adverse reactions were shown to be dose-dependent: impotence and abnormal ejaculation. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence. The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction in males and females with MDD, OCD, PD, SAD, GAD, and PTSD are displayed in Table 8 . Table 8. Adverse Reactions Related to Sexual Dysfunction in Patients Treated with Paroxetine in Clinical Trials of MDD, OCD, PD, SAD, GAD, and PTSD Paroxetine Placebo n (males) 1446 % 1042 % Decreased Libido 6 to15 0 to 5 Ejaculatory Disturbance 13 to 28 0 to 2 Impotence 2 to 9 0 to 3 n (females) 1822 % 1340 % Decreased Libido 0 to 9 0 to 2 Orgasmic Disturbance 2 to 9 0 to 1 Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae. Hallucinations In pooled clinical trials of paroxetine, hallucinations were observed in 0.2% of paroxetine-treated patients compared to 0.1% of patients receiving placebo.

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Acute pancreatitis, elevated liver function tests (the most severe cases were deaths due to liver necrosis, and grossly elevated transaminases associated with severe liver dysfunction), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion, prolactinemia and galactorrhea; extrapyramidal symptoms which have included akathisia, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, oculogyric crisis which has been associated with concomitant use of pimozide; status epilepticus, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, allergic alveolitis, anosmia, hyposmia, anaphylaxis, eclampsia, laryngismus, optic neuritis, porphyria, restless legs syndrome (RLS), ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (including torsade de pointes), hemolytic anemia, events related to impaired hematopoiesis (including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, and agranulocytosis), vasculitic syndromes (such as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura), and premature births in pregnant women. There has been a case report of severe hypotension when paroxetine was added to chronic metoprolol treatment."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 9 presents clinically significant drug interactions with paroxetine. Table 9: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact The concomitant use of SSRIs, including paroxetine, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Paroxetine is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Examples selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue Pimozide and Thioridazine Clinical Impact Increased plasma concentrations of pimozide and thioridazine, drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Intervention Paroxetine is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide or thioridazine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with paroxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of paroxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Examples other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John\u2019s Wort Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) Clinical Impact The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with paroxetine may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Intervention Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Examples aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein Clinical Impact Paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein. The concomitant use of paroxetine with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of paroxetine or other tightly-bound drugs in plasma . Intervention Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of paroxetine or other protein-bound drugs as warranted. Examples warfarin Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Clinical Impact Paroxetine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The concomitant use of paroxetine with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the CYP2D6 substrate. Intervention Decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed with concomitant paroxetine use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate may be needed if paroxetine is discontinued. Examples propafenone, flecainide, atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, venlafaxine, risperidone. Tamoxifen Clinical Impact Concomitant use of tamoxifen with paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite (endoxifen) and reduced efficacy of tamoxifen Intervention Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir Clinical Impact Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Intervention Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy). Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein : Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of paroxetine or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted. ( 7 ) Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 : Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 as warranted. ( 7 ) Concomitant use with tamoxifen : Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. ( 5.11 , 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Can cause fetal and neonatal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. ( 8.1 ) Nursing Mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Considerations]. Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. If paroxetine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, advise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. Clinical Considerations Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . For A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with >9,000 birth defect cases and >4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Treatment of Pregnant Women During Their Third Trimester : Neonates exposed to SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including paroxetine, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 \u2013 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20 th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There have also been postmarketing reports of premature births in pregnant women exposed to paroxetine or other SSRIs. When treating a pregnant woman with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment . A prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of paroxetine in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Animal Findings Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 6 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD \u2013 75 mg) on an mg/m 2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of developmental effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is than the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Like many other drugs, paroxetine is secreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from paroxetine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing infants or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Box Warning ]. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in three placebo-controlled trials in 752 paroxetine- treated pediatric patients with MDD. Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with paroxetine and occurred at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self- harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation. Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain. 8.5 Geriatric Use In premarketing clinical trials with paroxetine, 17% of patients treated with paroxetine (approximately 700) were 65 years of age or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; however, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. SSRIs including paroxetine, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. The initial dosage of paroxetine should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of MDD, SAD, OCD, PD, GAD, and PTSD is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5\u2011hydroxy-tryptamine, 5-HT). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses of paroxetine. In a meta-analysis of paroxetine from 4 studies done in healthy volunteers following multiple dosing of 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day, males did not exhibit a significantly lower C max or AUC than females. Absorption Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male subjects (n = 15) received 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days, steady-state paroxetine concentrations were achieved by approximately 10 days for most subjects, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. At steady state, mean values of C max , T max , C min , and T\u00bd were 61.7 ng/mL (CV 45%), 5.2 hr. (CV 10%), 30.7 ng/mL (CV 67%), and 21.0 hours (CV 32%), respectively. The steady-state C max and C min values were about 6 and 14 times what would be predicted from single-dose studies. Steady-state drug exposure based on AUC 0\u201124 was about 8 times greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data in these subjects. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. Effect of Food The effects of food on the bioavailability of paroxetine were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was only slightly increased (6%) when drug was administered with food but the C max was 29% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 6.4 hours post-dosing to 4.9 hours. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours (CV 32%) after oral dosing of 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days of paroxetine. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to C min values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg daily were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period. Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Figure 1. Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs (log scale) Figure 2. Impact of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine Theophylline: Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Paroxetine\u2019s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not expected to be of clinical significance. Specific Populations The impact of specific populations on the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine are shown in Figure 3 . The recommended starting dosage and maximum dosage of paroxetine is reduced in elderly patients, patients with severe renal impairment, and patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] .

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of MDD, SAD, OCD, PD, GAD, and PTSD is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5\u2011hydroxy-tryptamine, 5-HT)."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses of paroxetine. In a meta-analysis of paroxetine from 4 studies done in healthy volunteers following multiple dosing of 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day, males did not exhibit a significantly lower C max or AUC than females. Absorption Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male subjects (n = 15) received 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days, steady-state paroxetine concentrations were achieved by approximately 10 days for most subjects, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. At steady state, mean values of C max , T max , C min , and T\u00bd were 61.7 ng/mL (CV 45%), 5.2 hr. (CV 10%), 30.7 ng/mL (CV 67%), and 21.0 hours (CV 32%), respectively. The steady-state C max and C min values were about 6 and 14 times what would be predicted from single-dose studies. Steady-state drug exposure based on AUC 0\u201124 was about 8 times greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data in these subjects. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. Effect of Food The effects of food on the bioavailability of paroxetine were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was only slightly increased (6%) when drug was administered with food but the C max was 29% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 6.4 hours post-dosing to 4.9 hours. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours (CV 32%) after oral dosing of 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days of paroxetine. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to C min values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg daily were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period. Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Figure 1. Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs (log scale) Figure 2. Impact of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine Theophylline: Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Paroxetine\u2019s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not expected to be of clinical significance. Specific Populations The impact of specific populations on the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine are shown in Figure 3 . The recommended starting dosage and maximum dosage of paroxetine is reduced in elderly patients, patients with severe renal impairment, and patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] .

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are up to 2.0 (mouse) and 3.2 (rat) times the MRHD of 75 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 in vitro and 2 in vivo assays that included the following: Bacterial mutation assay, mouse lymphoma mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats. Impairment of Fertility Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men. A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is 2.4 times the MRHD of 75 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (8.2 and 4.1 times the MRHD of 75 mg on a mg/m 2 basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of paroxetine as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) has been established in 6 placebo-controlled studies of patients with MDD (aged 18 to 73). In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo in treating MDD by at least 2 of the following measures: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton depressed mood item, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity of Illness. Paroxetine was statistically significantly better than placebo in improvement of the HDRS sub-factor scores, including the depressed mood item, sleep disturbance factor, and anxiety factor. Long-term efficacy of paroxetine for treatment of MDD in outpatients was demonstrated in a randomized withdrawal study. Patients who responded to paroxetine (HDRS total score <8) during an initial 8-week open-label treatment phase were then randomized to continue paroxetine or placebo, for up to 1 year. Patients treated with paroxetine demonstrated a statistically significant lower relapse rate during the withdrawal phase (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients. 14.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) was demonstrated in two 12-week multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 and 2). Patients had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-IIIR) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 26. In study 1, a dose-range finding study, patients received fixed daily doses of paroxetine 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg. Study 1 demonstrated that daily doses of paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg are effective in the treatment of OCD. Patients receiving doses of paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg experienced a mean reduction of approximately 6 and 7 points, respectively, on the YBOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the approximate 4-point reduction at 20 mg and a 3-point reduction in the placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 60 mg daily with clomipramine 25 mg to 250 mg daily or placebo). In this study, patients receiving paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score, which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients. The following table provides the outcome classification by treatment group on Global Improvement items of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale for Study 1. Table 10: Outcome Classification (%) on CGI-Global Improvement Item for Completers in Study 1 in Patients with OCD Outcome Classification Placebo (n = 74) % Paroxetine 20 mg (n = 75) % Paroxetine 40 mg (n = 66) % Paroxetine 60 mg (n = 66) % Worse 14 7 7 3 No Change 44 35 22 19 Minimally Improved 24 33 29 34 Much Improved 11 18 22 24 Very Much Improved 7 7 20 20 Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. The long-term efficacy of paroxetine for the treatment of OCD was established in a long-term extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 3-month double-blind phase and a 6-month extension on open-label paroxetine 20 mg to 60 mg daily were randomized to either paroxetine or placebo in a 6-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients. 14.3 Panic Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was demonstrated in three 10- to 12-week multicenter, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Patients had PD (DSM-IIIR), with or without agoraphobia. In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo in treating PD by at least 2 out of 3 measures of panic attack frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness score. Study 1 was a 10-week dose-range finding study; patients received fixed doses of paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo. A statistically significant difference from placebo was observed only for the paroxetine 40 mg daily group. At endpoint, 76% of patients receiving paroxetine 40 mg daily were free of panic attacks, compared to 44% of placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily and placebo. At endpoint, 51% of paroxetine-treated patients were free of panic attacks compared to 32% of placebo-treated patients. Study 3 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily to placebo in patients concurrently receiving standardized cognitive behavioral therapy. At endpoint, 33% of the paroxetine-treated patients showed a reduction to 0 or 1 panic attacks compared to 14% of placebo-treated patients. In Studies 2 and 3, the mean paroxetine dose for completers at endpoint was approximately 40 mg daily. Long-term efficacy of paroxetine in PD was demonstrated in an extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 10-week double-blind phase and during a 3-month double-blind extension phase were randomized to either paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo in a 3\u2011month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. 14.4 Social Anxiety Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD) was demonstrated in three 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3) of adult outpatients with SAD (DSM-IV). In these studies, the effectiveness of paroxetine compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of (1) the proportion of responders, as defined by a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved), and (2) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Studies 1 and 2 were flexible-dose studies comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily and placebo. paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the CGI Improvement responder criterion and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). In Study 1, for patients who completed to week 12, 69% of paroxetine-treated patients compared to 29% of placebo-treated patients were CGI Improvement responders. In Study 2, CGI Improvement responders were 77% and 42% for the paroxetine- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Study 3 was a 12-week study comparing fixed doses of paroxetine 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg daily with placebo. Paroxetine 20 mg was statistically significantly superior to placebo on both the LSAS Total Score and the CGI Improvement responder criterion; there were trends for superiority over placebo for the paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg daily dose groups. There was no indication in this study of any additional benefit for doses higher than 20 mg daily. Subgroup analyses generally did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender. 14.5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was demonstrated in two 8-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) of adult outpatients with GAD (DSM-IV). Study 1 was an 8-week study comparing fixed doses of paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg daily with placebo. Doses of paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg were both demonstrated to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score. There was not sufficient evidence in this study to suggest a greater benefit for the paroxetine 40 mg daily dose compared to the 20 mg daily dose. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily and placebo. Paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score. A third study, a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily to placebo, did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority of paroxetine over placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score, the primary outcome. Subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender. There were insufficient elderly patients to conduct subgroup analyses on the basis of age. In a long-term trial, 566 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD, who had responded during a single-blind, 8-week acute treatment phase with paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily, were randomized to continuation of paroxetine at their same dose, or to placebo, for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the single-blind phase was defined by having a decrease of \u22652 points compared to baseline on the CGI-Severity of Illness scale, to a score of \u22643. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of \u22652 points compared to baseline on the CGI- Severity of Illness scale to a score of \u22654, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. Patients continuing to receive paroxetine experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate over the subsequent 24 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. 14.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was demonstrated in two 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The mean duration of PTSD symptoms for the 2 studies combined was 13 years (ranging from 0.1 year to 57 years). The percentage of patients with secondary MDD or non-PTSD anxiety disorders in the combined 2 studies was 41% (356 out of 858 patients) and 40% (345 out of 858 patients), respectively. Study outcome was assessed by (1) the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS-2) score and (2) the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I). The CAPS-2 is a multi-item instrument that measures 3 aspects of PTSD with the following symptom clusters: Reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing and hyperarousal. The 2 primary outcomes for each trial were (1) change from baseline to endpoint on the CAPS-2 total score (17 items), and (2) proportion of responders on the CGI-I, where responders were defined as patients having a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Study 1 was a 12-week study comparing fixed doses of paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg daily to placebo. Doses of paroxetine 20 mg and 40 mg were demonstrated to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for the CAPS-2 total score and on proportion of responders on the CGI-I. There was not sufficient evidence in this study to suggest a greater benefit for the 40 mg daily dose compared to the 20 mg daily dose. Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily to placebo. Paroxetine was demonstrated to be significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for the CAPS-2 total score and on proportion of responders on the CGI-I. A third study, a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily to placebo, demonstrated paroxetine to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for CAPS-2 total score, but not on proportion of responders on the CGI-I. The majority of patients in these trials were women (68% women: 377 out of 551 subjects in Study 1 and 66% women: 202 out of 303 subjects in Study 2). Subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender. There were an insufficient number of patients who were 65 years and older or were non-Caucasian to conduct subgroup analyses on the basis of age or race, respectively."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRI, SNRI, triptans), but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue Paroxetine and initiate supportive measures. ( 5.2 ) Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity: Can cause fetal and neonatal harm. Increased risk of cardiovascular malformations for exposure during the first trimester. Exposure in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension (PPNH) of the newborn. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulant drugs may increase risk. ( 5.5 ) Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder. ( 5.6 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders. ( 5.8 ) Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles, treated with antidepressants. ( 5.9 ) Sexual Dysfunction: Paroxetine may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2. Table 2: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18-24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 years old 1 fewer patient \u226565 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Paroxetine, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including Paroxetine, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of Paroxetine with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Paroxetine in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Paroxetine, discontinue Paroxetine before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Monitor all patients taking Paroxetine for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Paroxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Paroxetine with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide. Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias, the use of Paroxetine is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.4 Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity Paroxetine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations. Exposure to paroxetine in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPNH) and/or neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. If Paroxetine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking Paroxetine, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Paroxetine, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio. 5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with Paroxetine or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with Paroxetine, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.8 Seizures Paroxetine has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Paroxetine should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder and should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. 5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Paroxetine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Cases of angle-closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine hydrochloride tablets have been reported. Avoid use of antidepressants, including Paroxetine, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. 5.10 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Paroxetine. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue Paroxetine and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . 5.11 Reduction of Efficacy of Tamoxifen Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced with concomitant use of paroxetine as a result of paroxetine\u2019s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 and lower blood levels of tamoxifen [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. 5.12 Bone Fracture Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk during exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures. There are multiple possible causes for this observation, and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. 5.13 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including Paroxetine, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Paroxetine and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are included in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypersensitivity reactions to paroxetine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Increased Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Activation of Mania/Hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Discontinuation Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Angle-closure Glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Bone Fracture [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and at least twice placebo) in placebo-controlled MDD, PD, SAD, and PMDD clinical trials: abnormal ejaculation, abnormal vision, asthenia, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, female genital disorder, impotence, insomnia, libido decreased, nausea, somnolence, sweating, tremor. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-844-834-0530 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety data for Paroxetine is from 11 short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials including 3 studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 3 studies in patients with panic disorder (PD) (Studies 4, 5, and 6), 1 study in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Study 7), and 4 studies in female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . These 11 trials included 1627 patients treated with Paroxetine. Studies 1 and 2 were 12-week studies that enrolled patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine at doses ranging from 25 mg to 62.5 mg once daily. Study 3 was a 12-week study in patients 60 to 88 years old who received Paroxetine at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily. Studies 4, 5, and 6 were 10-week studies in patients 19 to 72 years old who received Paroxetine at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg once daily. Study 7 was a 12-week study that enrolled adult patients who received Paroxetine at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg once daily. Studies 8, 9, and 10 were 12-week, placebo-controlled trials in female patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Study 11 was a 12-week placebo-controlled trial in patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing) at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with MDD, PD, SAD, and PMDD In pooled studies in patients with MDD, PD and SAD, the most common adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal were: nausea (up to 4% of patients), asthenia, headache, depression, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests (each occurring in up to 2% of patients), and dizziness, somnolence, and diarrhea (each occurring in up to 1% of patients). In pooled studies for PMDD, the most common adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal were: nausea (occurring in up to 6% of patients), asthenia (occurring in up to 5% of patients), somnolence (occurring in up to 4% of patients), insomnia (occurring in approximately 2% of patients); and impaired concentration, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, sweating, tremor, yawn and diarrhea (occurring in less than or equal to 2% of patients). Adverse Reactions in MDD, PD, and SAD Table 3 presents the most common adverse reactions in Paroxetine-treated patients (incidence \u22655% and greater than placebo within at least 1 of the indications) in controlled trials in patients with MDD, PD, and SAD.

Dose Dependent Adverse Reactions Comparison of the incidence of adverse reactions (placebo vs. 12.5 mg Paroxetine vs. 25 mg Paroxetine) from studies 8, 9, 10 showed the following adverse reactions to be dose-related: Nausea, somnolence, sweating, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, tremor, impaired concentration, yawn, paresthesia, hyperkinesia, and vaginitis. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence. The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction in the Studies 1 and 2 (nonelderly patients with MDD), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are presented in Table 5: Table 5.

Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae. Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions occurred during the clinical studies of Paroxetine and are not included elsewhere in the labeling. Reactions are categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse reactions are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Cardiovascular System: Infrequent was postural hypotension. Hemic and Lymphatic System: Rare was thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Infrequent were generalized edema and hypercholesteremia. Nervous System: Infrequent were convulsion, akathisia, and manic reaction. Psychiatric: Infrequent were hallucinations. Skin and Appendages: Frequent was rash; infrequent was urticaria; rare was angioedema and erythema multiforme. Urogenital System: Infrequent was urinary retention; rare was urinary incontinence. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during post approval use of paroxetine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Acute pancreatitis, elevated liver function tests (the most severe cases were deaths due to liver necrosis, and grossly elevated transaminases associated with severe liver dysfunction), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, priapism, syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), prolactinemia and galactorrhea; extrapyramidal symptoms which have included akathisia, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dystonia, hypertonia, trismus; status epilepticus, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, allergic alveolitis, anaphylaxis, eclampsia, laryngismus, optic neuritis, porphyria, restless legs syndrome (RLS), ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (including torsade de pointes), hemolytic anemia, events related to impaired hematopoiesis (including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, and agranulocytosis), and vasculitic syndromes (such as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein: Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of Paroxetine or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted. ( 7 ) Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 as warranted. ( 7 ) Concomitant use with Tamoxifen: Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. ( 5 . 11 , 7 ) 7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions Table 6 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Paroxetine. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact The concomitant use of SSRIs, including Paroxetine, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Paroxetine is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Examples selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue Pimozide and Thioridazine Clinical Impact Increased plasma concentrations of pimozide and thioridazine, drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Intervention Paroxetine is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide or thioridazine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Paroxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of Paroxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Examples other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John\u2019s Wort Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) Clinical Impact The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with Paroxetine may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Intervention Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Examples aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein Clinical Impact Paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein. The concomitant use of Paroxetine with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of Paroxetine or other tightly-bound drugs in plasma . Intervention Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of Paroxetine or other protein-bound drugs as warranted. Examples warfarin Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Clinical Impact Paroxetine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The concomitant use of Paroxetine with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the CYP2D6 substrate. Intervention Decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed with concomitant Paroxetine use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate may be needed if Paroxetine is discontinued. Examples propafenone, flecainide, atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, venlafaxine, risperidone. Tamoxifen Clinical Impact Concomitant use of tamoxifen with Paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite (endoxifen) and reduced efficacy of tamoxifen Intervention Consider use of an alternative antidepressant little or no CYP2D6 inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir Clinical Impact Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Intervention Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Can cause fetal and neonatal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. If paroxetine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, advise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with >9,000 birth defect cases and >4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Treatment of Pregnant Women During Their Third Trimester : Neonates exposed to SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including Paroxetine, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 \u2013 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20 th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There have also been postmarketing reports of premature births in pregnant women exposed to paroxetine or other SSRIs. When treating a pregnant woman with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )] . A prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication. Animal Findings : Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 6 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD \u2013 75 mg) on an mg/m 2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of malformations. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day or approximately one-thirteens of the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Like many other drugs, paroxetine is secreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from Paroxetine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Three placebo-controlled trials in 752 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with immediate-release paroxetine, and effectiveness was not established in pediatric patients. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride and at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self-harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation. Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain. 8.5 Geriatric Use SSRIs and SNRIs, including Paroxetine, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] . In premarketing clinical trials with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride, 17% of paroxetine treated patients (approximately 700) were 65 years or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; however, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. The initial dosage should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tablets of Paroxetine contain a degradable polymeric matrix designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours. In addition to controlling the rate of drug release in vivo , an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until tablets of Paroxetine have left the stomach. Paroxetine extended-release tablets are completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of Paroxetine at 4 dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg), paroxetine C max and AUC 0-inf increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate-release formulations). Mean C max and AUC 0-inf values at these doses were 2.0, 5.5, 9.0, and 12.5 ng/mL, and 121, 261, 338, and 540 ng\u2022hr. /mL, respectively. T max was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post-dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate-release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg Paroxetine is not affected by food. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of Paroxetine (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg). During repeated administration of Paroxetine (25 mg once daily), steady state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate-release formulations). In a repeat-dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received Paroxetine (25 mg daily), mean steady state C max , C min , and AUC 0-24 values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 550 ng\u2022hr./mL, respectively. Based on studies using immediate-release formulations, steady-state drug exposure based on AUC 0-24 was several-fold greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate-release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway (Figure 3). Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period. The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of Paroxetine. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Figure 1. Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs (log scale) Figure 2. Impact of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine Theophylline: Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with immediate-release paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Paroxetine\u2019s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not expected to be of clinical significance.

    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tablets of Paroxetine contain a degradable polymeric matrix designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours. In addition to controlling the rate of drug release in vivo , an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until tablets of Paroxetine have left the stomach. Paroxetine extended-release tablets are completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of Paroxetine at 4 dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg), paroxetine C max and AUC 0-inf increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate-release formulations). Mean C max and AUC 0-inf values at these doses were 2.0, 5.5, 9.0, and 12.5 ng/mL, and 121, 261, 338, and 540 ng\u2022hr. /mL, respectively. T max was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post-dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate-release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg Paroxetine is not affected by food. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of Paroxetine (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg). During repeated administration of Paroxetine (25 mg once daily), steady state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate-release formulations). In a repeat-dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received Paroxetine (25 mg daily), mean steady state C max , C min , and AUC 0-24 values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 550 ng\u2022hr./mL, respectively. Based on studies using immediate-release formulations, steady-state drug exposure based on AUC 0-24 was several-fold greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate-release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway (Figure 3). Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period. The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of Paroxetine. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Figure 1. Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs (log scale) Figure 2. Impact of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine Theophylline: Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with immediate-release paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Paroxetine\u2019s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not expected to be of clinical significance. Specific Populations The impact of specific populations on the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine are shown in Figure 3. Figure 3.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are up to approximately 1.6 (mouse) and 2.5 (rat) times the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 in vitro and 2 in vivo assays that included the following: Bacterial mutation assay, mouse lymphoma mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats. Impairment of Fertility Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men. A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is approximately twice the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 3 times the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of Paroxetine as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) was established in two 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose studies with Paroxetine (Study 1 and Study 2) in adult patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria for MDD. Study 1 and 2 included patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine doses of 25 to 62.5 mg/day (N= 212) or placebo (N= 211) once daily compared to immediate-release paroxetine 20 to 50 mg (N=217). A third 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose study with Paroxetine (Study 3) included elderly patients, ranging in age from 60 to 88 years old and used Paroxetine doses of 12.5 to 50 mg/day (N=104) or placebo (N=109) once daily compared to immediate-release paroxetine 10 to 40 mg (N=106). In all three studies, Paroxetine was statistically superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms as measured by the following: the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score at Week 12, the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depressed Mood item score at Week 12, and the mean change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)\u2013Severity of Illness score. Long-term efficacy of paroxetine for treatment of MDD in outpatients was established with one randomized withdrawal study with immediate-release paroxetine. Patients who responded to immediate-release paroxetine (HDRS total score <8) during an initial 8-week open-label treatment phase were then randomized to continue immediate-release paroxetine or placebo, for up to 1 year. Patients treated with immediate-release paroxetine demonstrated a statistically significant lower relapse rate during the withdrawal phase (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients. 14.2 Panic Disorder The effectiveness of Paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was evaluated in three 10-week, multicenter, flexible-dose studies (Studies 4, 5, and 6) comparing Paroxetine (12.5 to 75 mg daily) to placebo in adult outpatients 19 to 72 years of age who met panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) criteria according to DSM-IV. These trials were assessed on the basis of their outcomes on 3 variables: (1) the proportions of patients free of full panic attacks at Week 10; (2) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median number of full panic attacks; and (3) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median Clinical Global Impression Severity score. For Studies 4 and 5, Paroxetine was superior to placebo on 2 of these 3 variables. Study 6 failed to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant difference between Paroxetine and placebo on any of these variables. For all 3 studies, the mean dose of Paroxetine for completers at Week 10 was approximately 50 mg/day. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. Long-term maintenance effects of paroxetine in patients with PD were demonstrated in a randomized-withdrawal study using immediate-release paroxetine. Patients who were responders during a 10-week, double-blind trial (followed by a 3-month double-blind maintenance phase) of immediate-release paroxetine were re-randomized to continue immediate-release paroxetine or placebo in a 3-month, double-blind withdrawal phase. Patients randomized to immediate-release paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients. 14.3 Social Anxiety Disorder The efficacy of Paroxetine as a treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD) was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of immediate-release paroxetine in the treatment of SAD. In addition, the effectiveness of Paroxetine in the treatment of SAD was demonstrated in one 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study of adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of SAD by DSM-IV criteria (Study 7). In Study 7, the effectiveness of Paroxetine (12.5 to 37.5 mg daily) compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of (1) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score at Week 12 and (2) the proportion of responders who scored 1 or 2 (very much improved or much improved) on the CGI Global Improvement score at Week 12. In Study 7, Paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the change on LSAS total score at Week 12 and the CGI Improvement responder criterion at Week 12. For patients who completed the trial, 64% of patients treated with Paroxetine compared to 35% of patients treated with placebo were CGI Improvement responders at Week 12. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender. Subgroup analyses of studies utilizing the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine generally did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender. 14.4 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder The effectiveness of Paroxetine for the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo-controlled trials in female patients ages 18 to 46 (Studies 8 and 9 [N=672]). Patients in these trials met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Of 1,030 patients including Study 10, who were treated with daily doses of Paroxetine 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles, the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 \u00b1 7 years. Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of Paroxetine in combination with systemic (including oral) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown. The VAS score is a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms associated with PMDD. In Studies 8 and 9, 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine were statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to Month 3 on the luteal phase VAS score. In an additional study employing luteal phase dosing (Study 11), patients (N = 366) were treated for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses with 12.5 or 25 mg/day of Paroxetine or placebo for a period of 3 months. In this trial, 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine, as luteal phase dosing, was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to luteal phase VAS score at Month 3. There is insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11."

In clinical trials the effectiveness of paroxetine was demonstrated in patients dosed in a range of 20 mg to 60 mg daily. While the safety of paroxetine has been evaluated in patients with SAD at doses up to 60 mg daily, available information does not suggest any additional benefit for doses above 20 mg daily [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )]. GAD The starting and recommended dosage in patients with GAD is 20 mg daily. In clinical trials the effectiveness of paroxetine in GAD was demonstrated in patients dosed in a range of 20 mg to 50 mg daily. There is not sufficient evidence to suggest a greater benefit to doses higher than 20 mg daily [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . In patients with an inadequate response, increase dosage in increments of 10 mg per day at intervals of at least 1 week, depending on tolerability. 2.4 Screen for Bipolar Disorder Prior to Starting Paroxetine Prior to initiating treatment with paroxetine or another antidepressant, screen patients for a personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )]. 2.5 Recommended Dosage for Elderly Patients, Patients with Severe Renal Impairment, and Patients with Severe Hepatic Impairment The recommended initial dosage is 10 mg per day for elderly patients, patients with severe renal impairment, and patients with severe hepatic impairment.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents (e.g., SSRI, SNRI, triptans), but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue paroxetine and initiate supportive measures. ( 5.2 ) Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity: Can cause fetal and neonatal harm. Increased risk of cardiovascular malformations with exposure during the first trimester. Exposure in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) Increased Risk of Bleeding : Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulant drugs may increase risk. ( 5.5 ) Activation of Mania/Hypomania : Screen patients for bipolar disorder. ( 5.6 ) Seizures : Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders. ( 5.8 ) Angle-Closure Glaucoma : Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles treated with antidepressants. ( 5.9 ) Sexual Dysfunction: paroxetine may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2 . Table 2. Risk Differences of the Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients with Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo < 18 years old 14 additional patients 18 to 24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25 to 64 years old 1 fewer patient \u2265 65 years old 6 fewer patients Paroxetine is not approved for use in pediatric patients. It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing paroxetine, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome SSRIs, including paroxetine, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines and St. John\u2019s Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of paroxetine with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate paroxetine in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection) or at lower doses. If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking paroxetine discontinue paroxetine before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Monitor all patients taking paroxetine for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with paroxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of paroxetine with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide. Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias, the use of paroxetine is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 5.4 Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity Paroxetine can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations. Exposure to paroxetine in late pregnancy may lead to an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPNH) and/or neonatal complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. If paroxetine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. 5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including paroxetine, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio. 5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with paroxetine or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of paroxetine, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with paroxetine, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )]. During clinical trials of GAD and PTSD, gradual decreases in the daily dose by 10 mg/day at weekly intervals followed by 1 week at 20 mg/day was used before treatment was discontinued. The following adverse reactions were reported at an incidence of 2% or greater for paroxetine and were at least twice that reported for placebo: Abnormal dreams, paresthesia, and dizziness Adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. 5.8 Seizures Paroxetine tablets, USP have not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. During clinical studies, seizures occurred in 0.1% of patients treated with paroxetine. Paroxetine should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder. Discontinue paroxetine in any patient who develops seizures. 5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including paroxetine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Cases of angle-closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine have been reported. Avoid use of antidepressants, including paroxetine in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. 5.10 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SSRIs, including paroxetine. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue paroxetine and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SSRIs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. 5.11 Reduction of Efficacy of Tamoxifen Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced with concomitant use of paroxetine as a result of paroxetine\u2019s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 and lower blood levels of tamoxifen [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. 5.12 Bone Fracture Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk during exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures. There are multiple possible causes for this observation, and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. 5.13 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including paroxetine, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of paroxetine and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment."

PD In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, and 40 mg in the treatment of PD, the following adverse reactions were shown to be dose-dependent: asthenia, dry mouth, anxiety, libido decreased, tremor, and abnormal ejaculation. SAD In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 20 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg in the treatment of SAD, for most of the adverse reactions, there was no clear relationship between adverse reactions and the dose of paroxetine to which patients were assigned. GAD In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 20 mg and 40 mg in the treatment of GAD, the following adverse reactions were shown to be dose-dependent: asthenia, constipation, and abnormal ejaculation. PTSD In a fixed-dose study comparing placebo and paroxetine 20 mg and 40 mg in the treatment of PTSD, the following adverse reactions were shown to be dose-dependent: impotence and abnormal ejaculation. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, however, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence. The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction in males and females with MDD, OCD, PD, SAD, GAD, and PTSD are displayed in Table 8 . Table 8. Adverse Reactions Related to Sexual Dysfunction in Patients Treated with Paroxetine in Clinical Trials of MDD, OCD, PD, SAD, GAD, and PTSD Paroxetine Placebo n (males) 1446 % 1042 % Decreased Libido 6 to15 0 to 5 Ejaculatory Disturbance 13 to 28 0 to 2 Impotence 2 to 9 0 to 3 n (females) 1822 % 1340 % Decreased Libido 0 to 9 0 to 2 Orgasmic Disturbance 2 to 9 0 to 1 Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae. Hallucinations In pooled clinical trials of paroxetine, hallucinations were observed in 0.2% of paroxetine-treated patients compared to 0.1% of patients receiving placebo. Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions occurred during the clinical studies of paroxetine and are not included elsewhere in the labeling.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 9 presents clinically significant drug interactions with paroxetine. Table 9: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact The concomitant use of SSRIs, including paroxetine, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Paroxetine is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Examples selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue Pimozide and Thioridazine Clinical Impact Increased plasma concentrations of pimozide and thioridazine, drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Intervention Paroxetine is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide or thioridazine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with paroxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of paroxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Examples other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John\u2019s Wort Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) Clinical Impact The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with paroxetine may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Intervention Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of paroxetine and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Examples aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein Clinical Impact Paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein. The concomitant use of paroxetine with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of paroxetine or other tightly-bound drugs in plasma . Intervention Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of paroxetine or other protein-bound drugs as warranted. Examples warfarin Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Clinical Impact Paroxetine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. The concomitant use of paroxetine with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the CYP2D6 substrate. Intervention Decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed with concomitant paroxetine use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate may be needed if paroxetine is discontinued. Examples propafenone, flecainide, atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, venlafaxine, risperidone. Tamoxifen Clinical Impact Concomitant use of tamoxifen with paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite (endoxifen) and reduced efficacy of tamoxifen Intervention Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir Clinical Impact Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Intervention Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy). Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein : Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of paroxetine or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted. ( 7 ) Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 : Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 as warranted. ( 7 ) Concomitant use with tamoxifen : Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. ( 5.11 , 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy : Can cause fetal and neonatal harm. Advise women of potential risk to the fetus. ( 8.1 ) Nursing Mothers : Discontinue drug or nursing, taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Considerations]. Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. If paroxetine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, advise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. Clinical Considerations Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . For A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with >9,000 birth defect cases and >4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Treatment of Pregnant Women During Their Third Trimester : Neonates exposed to SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including paroxetine, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 \u2013 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20 th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There have also been postmarketing reports of premature births in pregnant women exposed to paroxetine or other SSRIs. When treating a pregnant woman with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment . A prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of paroxetine in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Animal Findings Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 6 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD \u2013 75 mg) on an mg/m 2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of developmental effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is than the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Like many other drugs, paroxetine is secreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from paroxetine, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing infants or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Box Warning ]. Effectiveness was not demonstrated in three placebo-controlled trials in 752 paroxetine- treated pediatric patients with MDD. Antidepressants increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in pediatric patients [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with paroxetine and occurred at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self- harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation. Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain. 8.5 Geriatric Use In premarketing clinical trials with paroxetine, 17% of patients treated with paroxetine (approximately 700) were 65 years of age or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; however, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between elderly and younger patients [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. SSRIs including paroxetine, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )]. 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. The initial dosage of paroxetine should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment and in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Considerations]. Epidemiological studies have shown that infants exposed to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy have an increased risk of congenital malformations, particularly cardiovascular malformations. If paroxetine is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking paroxetine, advise the patient of the potential hazard to the fetus. Clinical Considerations Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . For A study based on Swedish national registry data demonstrated that infants exposed to paroxetine during pregnancy (n = 815) had an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (2% risk in paroxetine-exposed infants) compared to the entire registry population (1% risk), for an odds ratio (OR) of 1.8 (95% confidence interval 1.1 to 2.8). No increase in the risk of overall congenital malformations was seen in the paroxetine-exposed infants. The cardiac malformations in the paroxetine-exposed infants were primarily ventricular septal defects (VSDs) and atrial septal defects (ASDs). Septal defects range in severity from those that resolve spontaneously to those which require surgery. A separate retrospective cohort study from the United States (United Healthcare data) evaluated 5,956 infants of mothers dispensed antidepressants during the first trimester (n = 815 for paroxetine). This study showed a trend towards an increased risk for cardiovascular malformations for paroxetine (risk of 1.5%) compared to other antidepressants (risk of 1%), for an OR of 1.5 (95% confidence interval 0.8 to 2.9). Of the 12 paroxetine-exposed infants with cardiovascular malformations, 9 had VSDs. This study also suggested an increased risk of overall major congenital malformations including cardiovascular defects for paroxetine (4% risk) compared to other (2% risk) antidepressants (OR 1.8; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 2.8). Two large case-control studies using separate databases, each with >9,000 birth defect cases and >4,000 controls, found that maternal use of paroxetine during the first trimester of pregnancy was associated with a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of right ventricular outflow tract obstructions. In one study the OR was 2.5 (95% confidence interval, 1.0 to 6.0, 7 exposed infants) and in the other study the OR was 3.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.3 to 8.8, 6 exposed infants). Other studies have found varying results as to whether there was an increased risk of overall, cardiovascular, or specific congenital malformations. A meta-analysis of epidemiological data over a 16-year period (1992 to 2008) on first trimester paroxetine use in pregnancy and congenital malformations included the above-noted studies in addition to others (n = 17 studies that included overall malformations and n = 14 studies that included cardiovascular malformations; n = 20 distinct studies). While subject to limitations, this meta-analysis suggested an increased occurrence of cardiovascular malformations (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 1.9) and overall malformations (POR 1.2; 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 1.4) with paroxetine use during the first trimester. It was not possible in this meta-analysis to determine the extent to which the observed prevalence of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to that of overall malformations, nor was it possible to determine whether any specific types of cardiovascular malformations might have contributed to the observed prevalence of all cardiovascular malformations. Unless the benefits of paroxetine to the mother justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to either discontinuing paroxetine therapy or switching to another antidepressant [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] . For women who intend to become pregnant or are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should only be initiated after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Treatment of Pregnant Women During Their Third Trimester : Neonates exposed to SSRIs or serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), including paroxetine, late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremor, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These features are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs and SNRIs or, possibly, a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Exposure to SSRIs in late pregnancy may have an increased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). PPHN occurs in 1 \u2013 2 per 1,000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. In a retrospective case-control study of 377 women whose infants were born with PPHN and 836 women whose infants were born healthy, the risk for developing PPHN was approximately six-fold higher for infants exposed to SSRIs after the 20 th week of gestation compared to infants who had not been exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. There have also been postmarketing reports of premature births in pregnant women exposed to paroxetine or other SSRIs. When treating a pregnant woman with paroxetine during the third trimester, the physician should carefully consider both the potential risks and benefits of treatment . A prospective longitudinal study of 201 women with a history of major depression who were euthymic at the beginning of pregnancy. The women who discontinued antidepressant medication during pregnancy were more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continued antidepressant medication. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of paroxetine in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Animal Findings Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 6 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD \u2013 75 mg) on an mg/m 2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of developmental effects. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is than the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of MDD, SAD, OCD, PD, GAD, and PTSD is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5\u2011hydroxy-tryptamine, 5-HT). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Nonlinearity in pharmacokinetics is observed with increasing doses of paroxetine. In a meta-analysis of paroxetine from 4 studies done in healthy volunteers following multiple dosing of 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day, males did not exhibit a significantly lower C max or AUC than females. Absorption Paroxetine hydrochloride is completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male subjects (n = 15) received 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days, steady-state paroxetine concentrations were achieved by approximately 10 days for most subjects, although it may take substantially longer in an occasional patient. At steady state, mean values of C max , T max , C min , and T\u00bd were 61.7 ng/mL (CV 45%), 5.2 hr. (CV 10%), 30.7 ng/mL (CV 67%), and 21.0 hours (CV 32%), respectively. The steady-state C max and C min values were about 6 and 14 times what would be predicted from single-dose studies. Steady-state drug exposure based on AUC 0\u201124 was about 8 times greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data in these subjects. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. Effect of Food The effects of food on the bioavailability of paroxetine were studied in subjects administered a single dose with and without food. AUC was only slightly increased (6%) when drug was administered with food but the C max was 29% greater, while the time to reach peak plasma concentration decreased from 6.4 hours post-dosing to 4.9 hours. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life is approximately 21 hours (CV 32%) after oral dosing of 30 mg tablets daily for 30 days of paroxetine. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway. In comparison to C min values after 20 mg daily, values after 40 mg daily were only about 2 to 3 times greater than doubled. Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period. Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Figure 1. Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs (log scale) Figure 2. Impact of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine Theophylline: Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Paroxetine\u2019s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not expected to be of clinical significance. Specific Populations The impact of specific populations on the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine are shown in Figure 3 .

These doses are up to 2.0 (mouse) and 3.2 (rat) times the MRHD of 75 mg on a mg/m 2 basis. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 in vitro and 2 in vivo assays that included the following: Bacterial mutation assay, mouse lymphoma mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats. Impairment of Fertility Some clinical studies have shown that SSRIs (including paroxetine) may affect sperm quality during SSRI treatment, which may affect fertility in some men.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of paroxetine as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) has been established in 6 placebo-controlled studies of patients with MDD (aged 18 to 73). In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo in treating MDD by at least 2 of the following measures: Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Hamilton depressed mood item, and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity of Illness. Paroxetine was statistically significantly better than placebo in improvement of the HDRS sub-factor scores, including the depressed mood item, sleep disturbance factor, and anxiety factor. Long-term efficacy of paroxetine for treatment of MDD in outpatients was demonstrated in a randomized withdrawal study. Patients who responded to paroxetine (HDRS total score <8) during an initial 8-week open-label treatment phase were then randomized to continue paroxetine or placebo, for up to 1 year. Patients treated with paroxetine demonstrated a statistically significant lower relapse rate during the withdrawal phase (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients. 14.2 Obsessive Compulsive Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) was demonstrated in two 12-week multicenter placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1 and 2). Patients had moderate to severe OCD (DSM-IIIR) with mean baseline ratings on the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) total score ranging from 23 to 26. In study 1, a dose-range finding study, patients received fixed daily doses of paroxetine 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg. Study 1 demonstrated that daily doses of paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg are effective in the treatment of OCD. Patients receiving doses of paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg experienced a mean reduction of approximately 6 and 7 points, respectively, on the YBOCS total score which was statistically significantly greater than the approximate 4-point reduction at 20 mg and a 3-point reduction in the placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 60 mg daily with clomipramine 25 mg to 250 mg daily or placebo). In this study, patients receiving paroxetine experienced a mean reduction of approximately 7 points on the YBOCS total score, which was statistically significantly greater than the mean reduction of approximately 4 points in placebo-treated patients. The following table provides the outcome classification by treatment group on Global Improvement items of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale for Study 1. Table 10: Outcome Classification (%) on CGI-Global Improvement Item for Completers in Study 1 in Patients with OCD Outcome Classification Placebo (n = 74) % Paroxetine 20 mg (n = 75) % Paroxetine 40 mg (n = 66) % Paroxetine 60 mg (n = 66) % Worse 14 7 7 3 No Change 44 35 22 19 Minimally Improved 24 33 29 34 Much Improved 11 18 22 24 Very Much Improved 7 7 20 20 Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. The long-term efficacy of paroxetine for the treatment of OCD was established in a long-term extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 3-month double-blind phase and a 6-month extension on open-label paroxetine 20 mg to 60 mg daily were randomized to either paroxetine or placebo in a 6-month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients. 14.3 Panic Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was demonstrated in three 10- to 12-week multicenter, placebo-controlled studies of adult outpatients (Studies 1, 2, and 3). Patients had PD (DSM-IIIR), with or without agoraphobia. In these studies, paroxetine was shown to be statistically significantly more effective than placebo in treating PD by at least 2 out of 3 measures of panic attack frequency and on the Clinical Global Impression Severity of Illness score. Study 1 was a 10-week dose-range finding study; patients received fixed doses of paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo. A statistically significant difference from placebo was observed only for the paroxetine 40 mg daily group. At endpoint, 76% of patients receiving paroxetine 40 mg daily were free of panic attacks, compared to 44% of placebo-treated patients. Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily and placebo. At endpoint, 51% of paroxetine-treated patients were free of panic attacks compared to 32% of placebo-treated patients. Study 3 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 10 mg to 60 mg daily to placebo in patients concurrently receiving standardized cognitive behavioral therapy. At endpoint, 33% of the paroxetine-treated patients showed a reduction to 0 or 1 panic attacks compared to 14% of placebo-treated patients. In Studies 2 and 3, the mean paroxetine dose for completers at endpoint was approximately 40 mg daily. Long-term efficacy of paroxetine in PD was demonstrated in an extension to Study 1. Patients who responded to paroxetine during the 10-week double-blind phase and during a 3-month double-blind extension phase were randomized to either paroxetine 10 mg, 20 mg, or 40 mg daily or placebo in a 3\u2011month double-blind relapse prevention phase. Patients randomized to paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. 14.4 Social Anxiety Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of social anxiety disorder (SAD) was demonstrated in three 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3) of adult outpatients with SAD (DSM-IV). In these studies, the effectiveness of paroxetine compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of (1) the proportion of responders, as defined by a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) Improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved), and (2) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Studies 1 and 2 were flexible-dose studies comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily and placebo. paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the CGI Improvement responder criterion and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). In Study 1, for patients who completed to week 12, 69% of paroxetine-treated patients compared to 29% of placebo-treated patients were CGI Improvement responders. In Study 2, CGI Improvement responders were 77% and 42% for the paroxetine- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. Study 3 was a 12-week study comparing fixed doses of paroxetine 20 mg, 40 mg, or 60 mg daily with placebo. Paroxetine 20 mg was statistically significantly superior to placebo on both the LSAS Total Score and the CGI Improvement responder criterion; there were trends for superiority over placebo for the paroxetine 40 mg and 60 mg daily dose groups. There was no indication in this study of any additional benefit for doses higher than 20 mg daily. Subgroup analyses generally did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender. 14.5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) was demonstrated in two 8-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) of adult outpatients with GAD (DSM-IV). Study 1 was an 8-week study comparing fixed doses of paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg daily with placebo. Doses of paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg were both demonstrated to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score. There was not sufficient evidence in this study to suggest a greater benefit for the paroxetine 40 mg daily dose compared to the 20 mg daily dose. Study 2 was a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily and placebo. Paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score. A third study, a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily to placebo, did not demonstrate statistically significant superiority of paroxetine over placebo on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A) total score, the primary outcome. Subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of race or gender. There were insufficient elderly patients to conduct subgroup analyses on the basis of age. In a long-term trial, 566 patients meeting DSM-IV criteria for GAD, who had responded during a single-blind, 8-week acute treatment phase with paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily, were randomized to continuation of paroxetine at their same dose, or to placebo, for up to 24 weeks of observation for relapse. Response during the single-blind phase was defined by having a decrease of \u22652 points compared to baseline on the CGI-Severity of Illness scale, to a score of \u22643. Relapse during the double-blind phase was defined as an increase of \u22652 points compared to baseline on the CGI- Severity of Illness scale to a score of \u22654, or withdrawal due to lack of efficacy. Patients continuing to receive paroxetine experienced a statistically significantly lower relapse rate over the subsequent 24 weeks compared to those receiving placebo. 14.6 Posttraumatic Stress Disorder The effectiveness of paroxetine in the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) was demonstrated in two 12-week, multicenter, placebo-controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2) of adult outpatients who met DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. The mean duration of PTSD symptoms for the 2 studies combined was 13 years (ranging from 0.1 year to 57 years). The percentage of patients with secondary MDD or non-PTSD anxiety disorders in the combined 2 studies was 41% (356 out of 858 patients) and 40% (345 out of 858 patients), respectively. Study outcome was assessed by (1) the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale Part 2 (CAPS-2) score and (2) the Clinical Global Impression-Global Improvement Scale (CGI-I). The CAPS-2 is a multi-item instrument that measures 3 aspects of PTSD with the following symptom clusters: Reexperiencing/intrusion, avoidance/numbing and hyperarousal. The 2 primary outcomes for each trial were (1) change from baseline to endpoint on the CAPS-2 total score (17 items), and (2) proportion of responders on the CGI-I, where responders were defined as patients having a score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved). Study 1 was a 12-week study comparing fixed doses of paroxetine 20 mg or 40 mg daily to placebo. Doses of paroxetine 20 mg and 40 mg were demonstrated to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for the CAPS-2 total score and on proportion of responders on the CGI-I. There was not sufficient evidence in this study to suggest a greater benefit for the 40 mg daily dose compared to the 20 mg daily dose. Study 2 was a 12-week flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily to placebo. Paroxetine was demonstrated to be significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for the CAPS-2 total score and on proportion of responders on the CGI-I. A third study, a flexible-dose study comparing paroxetine 20 mg to 50 mg daily to placebo, demonstrated paroxetine to be statistically significantly superior to placebo on change from baseline for CAPS-2 total score, but not on proportion of responders on the CGI-I. The majority of patients in these trials were women (68% women: 377 out of 551 subjects in Study 1 and 66% women: 202 out of 303 subjects in Study 2). Subgroup analyses did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender. There were an insufficient number of patients who were 65 years and older or were non-Caucasian to conduct subgroup analyses on the basis of age or race, respectively."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Serotonin Syndrome: Increased risk when co-administered with other serotonergic agents, but also when taken alone. If occurs, discontinue Paroxetine and serotonergic agents and initiate supportive measures. ( 5.2 ) Embryofetal Toxicity: May cause fetal harm. Meta-analysis of epidemiological studies have shown increased risk (less than 2-fold) of cardiovascular malformations with exposure during the first trimester. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) Increased Risk of Bleeding: Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulant drugs may increase risk. ( 5.5 ) Activation of Mania/Hypomania: Screen patients for bipolar disorder. ( 5.6 ) Seizures: Use with caution in patients with seizure disorders. ( 5.8 ) Angle-Closure Glaucoma: Angle-closure glaucoma has occurred in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles, treated with antidepressants. ( 5.9 ) Sexual Dysfunction: Paroxetine may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Adolescents and Young Adults In pooled analyses of placebo-controlled trials of antidepressant drugs (SSRIs and other antidepressant classes) that included approximately 77,000 adult patients and 4,500 pediatric patients, the incidence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in antidepressant-treated patients age 24 years and younger was greater than in placebo-treated patients. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among drugs, but there was an increased risk identified in young patients for most drugs studied. There were differences in absolute risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the different indications, with the highest incidence in patients with MDD. The drug-placebo differences in the number of cases of suicidal thoughts and behaviors per 1000 patients treated are provided in Table 2. Table 2: Risk Differences of the Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in the Pooled Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressants in Pediatric and Adult Patients Age Range Drug-Placebo Difference in Number of Patients of Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors per 1,000 Patients Treated Increases Compared to Placebo <18 years old 14 additional patients 18-24 years old 5 additional patients Decreases Compared to Placebo 25-64 years old 1 fewer patient \u226565 years old 6 fewer patients It is unknown whether the risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults extends to longer-term use, i.e., beyond four months. However, there is substantial evidence from placebo-controlled maintenance trials in adults with MDD that antidepressants delay the recurrence of depression and that depression itself is a risk factor for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Monitor all antidepressant-treated patients for any indication for clinical worsening and emergence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, especially during the initial few months of drug therapy, and at times of dosage changes. Counsel family members or caregivers of patients to monitor for changes in behavior and to alert the healthcare provider. Consider changing the therapeutic regimen, including possibly discontinuing Paroxetine, in patients whose depression is persistently worse, or who are experiencing emergent suicidal thoughts or behaviors. 5.2 Serotonin Syndrome Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) and SSRIs, including Paroxetine, can precipitate serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition. The risk is increased with concomitant use of other serotonergic drugs (including triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, fentanyl, lithium, tramadol, meperidine, methadone, tryptophan, buspirone, amphetamines, and St. John's Wort) and with drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin, i.e., MAOIs [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Serotonin syndrome can also occur when these drugs are used alone. Serotonin syndrome signs and symptoms may include mental status changes (e.g., agitation, hallucinations, delirium, and coma), autonomic instability (e.g., tachycardia, labile blood pressure, dizziness, diaphoresis, flushing, hyperthermia), neuromuscular symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, myoclonus, hyperreflexia, incoordination), seizures, and gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g., nausea, vomiting, diarrhea). The concomitant use of Paroxetine with MAOIs is contraindicated. In addition, do not initiate Paroxetine in a patient being treated with MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue. No reports involved the administration of methylene blue by other routes (such as oral tablets or local tissue injection). If it is necessary to initiate treatment with an MAOI such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue in a patient taking Paroxetine, discontinue Paroxetine before initiating treatment with the MAOI [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Monitor all patients taking Paroxetine for the emergence of serotonin syndrome. Discontinue treatment with Paroxetine and any concomitant serotonergic agents immediately if the above symptoms occur, and initiate supportive symptomatic treatment. If concomitant use of Paroxetine with other serotonergic drugs is clinically warranted, inform patients of the increased risk for serotonin syndrome and monitor for symptoms. 5.3 Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation The CYP2D6 inhibitory properties of paroxetine can elevate plasma levels of thioridazine and pimozide. Since thioridazine and pimozide given alone produce prolongation of the QTc interval and increase the risk of serious ventricular arrhythmias, the use of Paroxetine is contraindicated in combination with thioridazine and pimozide [see Contraindications ( 4 ), Drug Interactions ( 7 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 5.4 Embryofetal Toxicity Based on meta-analyses of epidemiological studies, exposure to paroxetine in the first trimester of pregnancy is associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the rate of cardiovascular malformations among infants. For women who intend to become pregnant or who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, Paroxetine, should be initiated only after consideration of the other available treatment options [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . 5.5 Increased Risk of Bleeding Drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake inhibition, including Paroxetine, increase the risk of bleeding events. Concomitant use of aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), other antiplatelet drugs, warfarin, and other anticoagulants may add to this risk. Case reports and epidemiological studies (case-control and cohort design) have demonstrated an association between use of drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake and the occurrence of gastrointestinal bleeding. Based on data from the published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )]. Bleeding events related to drugs that interfere with serotonin reuptake have ranged from ecchymoses, hematomas, epistaxis, and petechiae to life-threatening hemorrhages. Inform patients about the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine and antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio. 5.6 Activation of Mania or Hypomania In patients with bipolar disorder, treating a depressive episode with Paroxetine or another antidepressant may precipitate a mixed/manic episode. During controlled clinical trials of immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride, hypomania or mania occurred in approximately 1% of paroxetine-treated unipolar patients compared to 1.1% of active-control and 0.3% of placebo-treated unipolar patients. Prior to initiating treatment with Paroxetine, screen patients for any personal or family history of bipolar disorder, mania, or hypomania. 5.7 Discontinuation Syndrome Adverse reactions after discontinuation of serotonergic antidepressants, particularly after abrupt discontinuation, include: nausea, sweating, dysphoric mood, irritability, agitation, dizziness, sensory disturbances (e.g., paresthesia, such as electric shock sensations), tremor, anxiety, confusion, headache, lethargy, emotional lability, insomnia, hypomania, tinnitus, and seizures. A gradual reduction in dosage rather than abrupt cessation is recommended whenever possible [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.7 )] . Adverse reactions have been reported upon discontinuation of treatment with paroxetine in pediatric patients. The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning , Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ), Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . 5.8 Seizures Paroxetine has not been systematically evaluated in patients with seizure disorders. Patients with history of seizures were excluded from clinical studies. Paroxetine should be prescribed with caution in patients with a seizure disorder and should be discontinued in any patient who develops seizures. 5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including Paroxetine may trigger an angle closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy. Cases of angle-closure glaucoma associated with use of paroxetine hydrochloride tablets have been reported. Avoid use of antidepressants, including Paroxetine, in patients with untreated anatomically narrow angles. 5.10 Hyponatremia Hyponatremia may occur as a result of treatment with SNRIs and SSRIs, including Paroxetine. Cases with serum sodium lower than 110 mmol/L have been reported. Signs and symptoms of hyponatremia include headache, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, confusion, weakness, and unsteadiness, which may lead to falls. Signs and symptoms associated with more severe and/or acute cases have included hallucination, syncope, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest, and death. In many cases, this hyponatremia appears to be the result of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). In patients with symptomatic hyponatremia, discontinue Paroxetine and institute appropriate medical intervention. Elderly patients, patients taking diuretics, and those who are volume-depleted may be at greater risk of developing hyponatremia with SNRIs and SSRIs [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . 5.11 Reduction of Efficacy of Tamoxifen Some studies have shown that the efficacy of tamoxifen, as measured by the risk of breast cancer relapse/mortality, may be reduced with concomitant use of paroxetine as a result of paroxetine\u2019s irreversible inhibition of CYP2D6 and lower blood levels of tamoxifen [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . One study suggests that the risk may increase with longer duration of coadministration. However, other studies have failed to demonstrate such a risk. When tamoxifen is used for the treatment or prevention of breast cancer, prescribers should consider using an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. 5.12 Bone Fracture Epidemiological studies on bone fracture risk during exposure to some antidepressants, including SSRIs, have reported an association between antidepressant treatment and fractures. There are multiple possible causes for this observation, and it is unknown to what extent fracture risk is directly attributable to SSRI treatment. 5.13 Sexual Dysfunction Use of SSRIs, including Paroxetine, may cause symptoms of sexual dysfunction [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . In male patients, SSRI use may result in ejaculatory delay or failure, decreased libido, and erectile dysfunction. In female patients, SSRI use may result in decreased libido and delayed or absent orgasm. It is important for prescribers to inquire about sexual function prior to initiation of Paroxetine and to inquire specifically about changes in sexual function during treatment, because sexual function may not be spontaneously reported. When evaluating changes in sexual function, obtaining a detailed history (including timing of symptom onset) is important because sexual symptoms may have other causes, including the underlying psychiatric disorder. Discuss potential management strategies to support patients in making informed decisions about treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are included in more detail in other sections of the prescribing information: Hypersensitivity reactions to paroxetine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Serotonin Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Embryofetal and Neonatal Toxicity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Increased Risk of Bleeding [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] Activation of Mania/Hypomania [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.6 )] Discontinuation Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] Seizures [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] Angle-closure Glaucoma [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 )] Hyponatremia [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] Bone Fracture [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.12 )] Sexual Dysfunction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] Most common adverse reactions (\u22655% and at least twice placebo) in placebo-controlled MDD, PD, SAD, and PMDD clinical trials: abnormal ejaculation, abnormal vision, asthenia, constipation, decreased appetite, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, female genital disorder, impotence, insomnia, libido decreased, nausea, somnolence, sweating, tremor. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Lannett Company, Inc. at 1-844-834-0530 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Safety data for Paroxetine is from 11 short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials including 3 studies in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) (Studies 1, 2, and 3), 3 studies in patients with panic disorder (PD) (Studies 4, 5, and 6), 1 study in patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Study 7), and 4 studies in female patients with premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) (Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11) [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )] . These 11 trials included 1627 patients treated with Paroxetine. Studies 1 and 2 were 12-week studies that enrolled patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine at doses ranging from 25 mg to 62.5 mg once daily. Study 3 was a 12-week study in patients 60 to 88 years old who received Paroxetine at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 50 mg once daily. Studies 4, 5, and 6 were 10-week studies in patients 19 to 72 years old who received Paroxetine at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 75 mg once daily. Study 7 was a 12-week study that enrolled adult patients who received Paroxetine at doses ranging from 12.5 mg to 37.5 mg once daily. Studies 8, 9, and 10 were 12-week, placebo-controlled trials in female patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Study 11 was a 12-week placebo-controlled trial in patients 18 to 46 years old who received Paroxetine 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses (luteal phase dosing) at doses of 12.5 mg or 25 mg once daily. Adverse Reactions Leading to Discontinuation in Patients with MDD, PD, SAD, and PMDD In pooled studies in patients with MDD, PD and SAD, the most common adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal were: nausea (up to 4% of patients), asthenia, headache, depression, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests (each occurring in up to 2% of patients), and dizziness, somnolence, and diarrhea (each occurring in up to 1% of patients). In pooled studies for PMDD, the most common adverse reactions leading to study withdrawal were: nausea (occurring in up to 6% of patients), asthenia (occurring in up to 5% of patients), somnolence (occurring in up to 4% of patients), insomnia (occurring in approximately 2% of patients); and impaired concentration, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, sweating, tremor, yawn and diarrhea (occurring in less than or equal to 2% of patients). Adverse Reactions in MDD, PD, and SAD Table 3 presents the most common adverse reactions in Paroxetine-treated patients (incidence \u22655% and greater than placebo within at least 1 of the indications) in controlled trials in patients with MDD, PD, and SAD.

Dose Dependent Adverse Reactions Comparison of the incidence of adverse reactions (placebo vs. 12.5 mg Paroxetine vs. 25 mg Paroxetine) from studies 8, 9, 10 showed the following adverse reactions to be dose-related: Nausea, somnolence, sweating, dry mouth, dizziness, decreased appetite, tremor, impaired concentration, yawn, paresthesia, hyperkinesia, and vaginitis. Male and Female Sexual Dysfunction Although changes in sexual desire, sexual performance, and sexual satisfaction often occur as manifestations of a psychiatric disorder, they may also be a consequence of SSRI treatment. However, reliable estimates of the incidence and severity of untoward experiences involving sexual desire, performance, and satisfaction are difficult to obtain, in part because patients and healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss them. Accordingly, estimates of the incidence of untoward sexual experience and performance cited in labeling may underestimate their actual incidence. The percentage of patients reporting symptoms of sexual dysfunction in the Studies 1 and 2 (nonelderly patients with MDD), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11 are presented in Table 5: Table 5.

Paroxetine treatment has been associated with several cases of priapism. In those cases with a known outcome, patients recovered without sequelae. Less Common Adverse Reactions The following adverse reactions occurred during the clinical studies of Paroxetine and are not included elsewhere in the labeling. Reactions are categorized by body system and listed in order of decreasing frequency according to the following definitions: Frequent adverse reactions are those occurring on 1 or more occasions in at least 1/100 patients; infrequent adverse reactions are those occurring in 1/100 to 1/1,000 patients; rare reactions are those occurring in fewer than 1/1,000 patients. Cardiovascular System: Infrequent was postural hypotension. Hemic and Lymphatic System: Rare was thrombocytopenia. Metabolic and Nutritional Disorders: Infrequent were generalized edema and hypercholesteremia. Nervous System: Infrequent were convulsion, akathisia, and manic reaction. Psychiatric: Infrequent were hallucinations. Skin and Appendages: Frequent was rash; infrequent was urticaria; rare was angioedema and erythema multiforme. Urogenital System: Infrequent was urinary retention; rare was urinary incontinence. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following reactions have been identified during post approval use of paroxetine. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of unknown size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Acute pancreatitis, elevated liver function tests (the most severe cases were deaths due to liver necrosis, and grossly elevated transaminases associated with severe liver dysfunction), Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), priapism, syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH), prolactinemia and galactorrhea; extrapyramidal symptoms which have included akathisia, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, dystonia, hypertonia, trismus; status epilepticus, acute renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, allergic alveolitis, anosmia, hyposmia, anaphylaxis, eclampsia, laryngismus, optic neuritis, porphyria, restless legs syndrome (RLS), ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (including torsade de pointes), hemolytic anemia, events related to impaired hematopoiesis (including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, bone marrow aplasia, and agranulocytosis), and vasculitic syndromes (such as Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein: Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of Paroxetine or other protein-bound drugs (e.g., warfarin) as warranted. ( 7 ) Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6: Reduce dosage of drugs metabolized by CYP2D6 as warranted. ( 7 ) Concomitant use with Tamoxifen: Consider use of an alternative antidepressant with little or no CYP2D6 inhibition. ( 5 . 11 , 7 ) 7.1 Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine Table 6 includes clinically significant drug interactions with Paroxetine. Table 6: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with Paroxetine Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Clinical Impact The concomitant use of SSRIs, including Paroxetine, and MAOIs increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Paroxetine is contraindicated in patients taking MAOIs, including MAOIs such as linezolid or intravenous methylene blue [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), Contraindications ( 4 ), Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Examples selegiline, tranylcypromine, isocarboxazid, phenelzine, linezolid, methylene blue Pimozide and Thioridazine Clinical Impact Increased plasma concentrations of pimozide and thioridazine, drugs with a narrow therapeutic index, may increase the risk of QTc prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias. Intervention Paroxetine is contraindicated in patients taking pimozide or thioridazine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Other Serotonergic Drugs Clinical Impact The concomitant use of serotonergic drugs with Paroxetine increases the risk of serotonin syndrome. Intervention Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome, particularly during treatment initiation and dosage increases. If serotonin syndrome occurs, consider discontinuation of Paroxetine and/or concomitant serotonergic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . Examples Other SSRIs, SNRIs, triptans, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, lithium, tryptophan, buspirone, St. John\u2019s Wort Drugs that Interfere with Hemostasis (antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants) Clinical Impact The concurrent use of an antiplatelet agent or anticoagulant with Paroxetine may potentiate the risk of bleeding. Intervention Inform patients of the increased risk of bleeding associated with the concomitant use of Paroxetine and antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants. For patients taking warfarin, carefully monitor the international normalized ratio [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . Examples aspirin, clopidogrel, heparin, warfarin Drugs Highly Bound to Plasma Protein Clinical Impact Paroxetine is highly bound to plasma protein. The concomitant use of Paroxetine with another drug that is highly bound to plasma protein may increase free concentrations of Paroxetine or other tightly-bound drugs in plasma . Intervention Monitor for adverse reactions and reduce dosage of Paroxetine or other protein-bound drugs as warranted. Examples warfarin Drugs Metabolized by CYP2D6 Clinical Impact Paroxetine is a CYP2D6 inhibitor [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The concomitant use of Paroxetine with a CYP2D6 substrate may increase the exposure of the CYP2D6 substrate. Intervention Decrease the dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate if needed with concomitant Paroxetine use. Conversely, an increase in dosage of a CYP2D6 substrate may be needed if Paroxetine is discontinued. Examples propafenone, flecainide, atomoxetine, desipramine, dextromethorphan, metoprolol, nebivolol, perphenazine, tolterodine, venlafaxine, risperidone. Tamoxifen Clinical Impact Concomitant use of tamoxifen with Paroxetine may lead to reduced plasma concentrations of the active metabolite (endoxifen) and reduced efficacy of tamoxifen Intervention Consider use of an alternative antidepressant little or no CYP2D6 inhibition [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir Clinical Impact Co-administration of fosamprenavir/ritonavir with paroxetine significantly decreased plasma levels of paroxetine. Intervention Any dose adjustment should be guided by clinical effect (tolerability and efficacy)."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: SSRI use, particularly later in pregnancy, may increase the risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension and symptoms of poor adaptation (respiratory distress, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, hypotonia, irritability) in the neonate. ( 5.4 , 8.1 ) Nursing Mothers: Discontinue drug or nursing taking into consideration importance of drug to mother. ( 8.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Exposure Registry There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to antidepressants during pregnancy. Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients by calling the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-866-961-2388 or visiting online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants/ . Risk Summary Based on data from published observational studies, exposure to SSRIs, particularly in the month before delivery, has been associated with a less than 2-fold increase in the risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ) and Clinical Considerations ]. Paroxetine is associated with a less than 2-fold increase in cardiovascular malformations when administered to a pregnant woman during the first trimester. While individual epidemiological studies on the association between paroxetine use and cardiovascular malformations have reported inconsistent findings, some meta-analyses of epidemiological studies have identified an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations (see Data ) . There are risks of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see Data ) and/or poor neonatal adaptation with exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including Paroxetine, during pregnancy. There also are risks associated with untreated depression in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ). For women who intend to become pregnant or who are in their first trimester of pregnancy, paroxetine should be initiated only after consideration of the other available treatment options. No evidence of treatment related malformations was observed in animal reproduction studies, when paroxetine was administered during the period of organogenesis at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits. These doses are approximately 6 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD \u2013 75 mg) on an mg/m 2 basis. When paroxetine was administered to female rats during the last trimester of gestation and continued through lactation, there was an increase in the number of pup deaths during the first four days of lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is less than the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis (see Data ). The estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Women who discontinue antidepressants during pregnancy are more likely to experience a relapse of major depression than women who continue antidepressants. This finding is from a prospective longitudinal study of 201 pregnant women with a history of major depressive disorder who were euthymic and taking antidepressants at the beginning of pregnancy. Consider the risks of untreated depression when discontinuing or changing treatment with antidepressant medication during pregnancy and postpartum. Maternal Adverse Reactions Use of Paroxetine in the month before delivery may be associated with an increased risk of postpartum hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions Neonates exposed to Paroxetine and other SSRIs late in the third trimester have developed complications requiring prolonged hospitalization, respiratory support, and tube feeding. Such complications can arise immediately upon delivery. Reported clinical findings have included respiratory distress, cyanosis, apnea, seizures, temperature instability, feeding difficulty, vomiting, hypoglycemia, hypotonia, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, tremors, jitteriness, irritability, and constant crying. These findings are consistent with either a direct toxic effect of SSRIs or possibly a drug discontinuation syndrome. It should be noted that, in some cases, the clinical picture is consistent with serotonin syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . Data Human Data Published epidemiological studies on the association between first trimester paroxetine use and cardiovascular malformations have reported inconsistent results; however, meta-analyses of population-based cohort studies published between 1996-2017 indicate a less than 2-fold increased risk for overall cardiovascular malformations. Specific cardiac malformations identified in two meta-analyses include approximately 2 to 2.5-fold increased risk for right ventricular outflow tract defects. One meta-analysis also identified an increased risk (less than 2-fold) for bulbus cordis anomalies and anomalies of cardiac septal closure, and an increased risk for atrial septal defects (pooled OR 2.38, 95% CI 1.14-4.97). Important limitations of the studies included in these meta-analyses include potential confounding by indication, depression severity, and potential exposure misclassification. Exposure to SSRIs, particularly later in pregnancy, may have an increased risk for PPHN. PPHN occurs in 1-2 per 1000 live births in the general population and is associated with substantial neonatal morbidity and mortality. Animal Data Reproduction studies were performed at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day in rats and 6 mg/kg/day in rabbits administered during organogenesis. These doses are approximately 6 (rat) and less than 2 (rabbit) times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD \u2013 75 mg) on an mg/m 2 basis. These studies have revealed no evidence of malformations. However, in rats, there was an increase in pup deaths during the first 4 days of lactation when dosing occurred during the last trimester of gestation and continued throughout lactation. This effect occurred at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day which is less than the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. The no-effect dose for rat pup mortality was not determined. The cause of these deaths is not known. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Data from the published literature report the presence of paroxetine in human milk (see Data ) . There are reports of agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain in infants exposed to paroxetine through breast milk (see Clinical Considerations ). There are no data on the effects of paroxetine on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Paroxetine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Paroxetine or the underlying maternal condition. Clinical Considerations Infants exposed to Paroxetine should be monitored for agitation, irritability, poor feeding and poor weight gain. Data Published literature suggests the presence of paroxetine in human milk with relative infant doses ranging between 0.4% to 2.2%, and a milk: plasma ratio of <1. No significant amounts were detected in the plasma of infants after breastfeeding. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility Male Based on findings from clinical studies, paroxetine may affect sperm quality which may impair fertility; it is not known if this effect is reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology ( 13.1 )] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Paroxetine in pediatric patients have not been established [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . Three placebo-controlled trials in 752 pediatric patients with MDD have been conducted with immediate-release paroxetine, and effectiveness was not established in pediatric patients. Decreased appetite and weight loss have been observed in association with the use of SSRIs. In placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted with pediatric patients, the following adverse reactions were reported in at least 2% of pediatric patients treated with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride and at a rate at least twice that for pediatric patients receiving placebo: emotional lability (including self-harm, suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide, crying, and mood fluctuations), hostility, decreased appetite, tremor, sweating, hyperkinesia, and agitation. Adverse reactions upon discontinuation of treatment with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride in the pediatric clinical trials that included a taper phase regimen, which occurred in at least 2% of patients and at a rate at least twice that of placebo, were: emotional lability (including suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, mood changes, and tearfulness), nervousness, dizziness, nausea, and abdominal pain. 8.5 Geriatric Use SSRIs and SNRIs, including Paroxetine, have been associated with cases of clinically significant hyponatremia in elderly patients, who may be at greater risk for this adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.9 ) ] . In premarketing clinical trials with immediate-release paroxetine hydrochloride, 17% of paroxetine treated patients (approximately 700) were 65 years or older. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed a decreased clearance in the elderly, and a lower starting dose is recommended; however, no overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal and/or Hepatic Impairment Increased plasma concentrations of paroxetine occur in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. The initial dosage of Paroxetine should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment and patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT). 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tablets of Paroxetine contain a degradable polymeric matrix designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours. In addition to controlling the rate of drug release in vivo , an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until tablets of Paroxetine have left the stomach. Paroxetine extended-release tablets are completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of Paroxetine at 4 dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg), paroxetine C max and AUC 0-inf increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate-release formulations). Mean C max and AUC 0-inf values at these doses were 2.0, 5.5, 9.0, and 12.5 ng/mL, and 121, 261, 338, and 540 ng\u2022hr. /mL, respectively. T max was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post-dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate-release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg Paroxetine is not affected by food. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of Paroxetine (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg). During repeated administration of Paroxetine (25 mg once daily), steady state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate-release formulations). In a repeat-dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received Paroxetine (25 mg daily), mean steady state C max , C min , and AUC 0-24 values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 550 ng\u2022hr./mL, respectively. Based on studies using immediate-release formulations, steady-state drug exposure based on AUC 0-24 was several-fold greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate-release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway (Figure 3). Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period. About 36% was excreted in the feces (probably via the bile), mostly as metabolites and less than 1% as the parent compound over the 10-day post-dosing period. The elimination half-life is approximately 15 to 20 hours after a single dose of Paroxetine. Paroxetine metabolism is mediated in part by CYP2D6, and the metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine and to some extent in the feces. Pharmacokinetic behavior of paroxetine has not been evaluated in subjects who are deficient in CYP2D6 (poor metabolizers). Drug Interaction Studies There are clinically significant, known drug interactions between paroxetine and other drugs [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Figure 1. Impact of Paroxetine on the Pharmacokinetics of Co-Administered Drugs (log scale) Figure 2. Impact of Co-Administered Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Paroxetine Theophylline: Reports of elevated theophylline levels associated with immediate-release paroxetine treatment have been reported. While this interaction has not been formally studied, it is recommended that theophylline levels be monitored when these drugs are concurrently administered. Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome CYP3A4 An in vivo interaction study involving the coadministration under steady-state conditions of paroxetine and terfenadine, a substrate for CYP3A4, revealed no effect of paroxetine on terfenadine pharmacokinetics. In addition, in vitro studies have shown ketoconazole, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 activity, to be at least 100 times more potent than paroxetine as an inhibitor of the metabolism of several substrates for this enzyme, including terfenadine, astemizole, cisapride, triazolam, and cyclosporine. Paroxetine\u2019s extent of inhibition of CYP3A4 activity is not expected to be of clinical significance.

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action The mechanism of action of paroxetine in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is unknown, but is presumed to be linked to potentiation of serotonergic activity in the central nervous system resulting from inhibition of neuronal reuptake of serotonin (5-HT)."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Studies at clinically relevant doses in humans have demonstrated that paroxetine blocks the uptake of serotonin into human platelets. In vitro studies in animals also suggest that paroxetine is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake (SSRI) and has only very weak effects on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption Tablets of Paroxetine contain a degradable polymeric matrix designed to control the dissolution rate of paroxetine over a period of approximately 4 to 5 hours. In addition to controlling the rate of drug release in vivo , an enteric coat delays the start of drug release until tablets of Paroxetine have left the stomach. Paroxetine extended-release tablets are completely absorbed after oral dosing of a solution of the hydrochloride salt. In a study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received single oral doses of Paroxetine at 4 dosage strengths (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg), paroxetine C max and AUC 0-inf increased disproportionately with dose (as seen also with immediate-release formulations). Mean C max and AUC 0-inf values at these doses were 2.0, 5.5, 9.0, and 12.5 ng/mL, and 121, 261, 338, and 540 ng\u2022hr. /mL, respectively. T max was observed typically between 6 and 10 hours post-dose, reflecting a reduction in absorption rate compared with immediate-release formulations. The bioavailability of 25 mg Paroxetine is not affected by food. Distribution Paroxetine distributes throughout the body, including the CNS, with only 1% remaining in the plasma. Approximately 95% and 93% of paroxetine is bound to plasma protein at 100 ng/mL and 400 ng/mL, respectively. Under clinical conditions, paroxetine concentrations would normally be less than 400 ng/mL. Paroxetine does not alter the in vitro protein binding of phenytoin or warfarin. Elimination Metabolism The mean elimination half-life of paroxetine was 15 to 20 hours throughout a range of single doses of Paroxetine (12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, and 50 mg). During repeated administration of Paroxetine (25 mg once daily), steady state was reached within 2 weeks (i.e., comparable to immediate-release formulations). In a repeat-dose study in which normal male and female subjects (n = 23) received Paroxetine (25 mg daily), mean steady state C max , C min , and AUC 0-24 values were 30 ng/mL, 20 ng/mL, and 550 ng\u2022hr./mL, respectively. Based on studies using immediate-release formulations, steady-state drug exposure based on AUC 0-24 was several-fold greater than would have been predicted from single-dose data. The excess accumulation is a consequence of the fact that 1 of the enzymes that metabolizes paroxetine is readily saturable. In steady-state dose proportionality studies involving elderly and nonelderly patients, at doses of the immediate-release formulation of 20 mg to 40 mg daily for the elderly and 20 mg to 50 mg daily for the nonelderly, some nonlinearity was observed in both populations, again reflecting a saturable metabolic pathway (Figure 3). Paroxetine is extensively metabolized after oral administration. The principal metabolites are polar and conjugated products of oxidation and methylation, which are readily cleared. Conjugates with glucuronic acid and sulfate predominate, and major metabolites have been isolated and identified. Data indicate that the metabolites have no more than 1/50 the potency of the parent compound at inhibiting serotonin uptake. The metabolism of paroxetine is accomplished in part by CYP2D6. Saturation of this enzyme at clinical doses appears to account for the nonlinearity of paroxetine kinetics with increasing dose and increasing duration of treatment. The role of this enzyme in paroxetine metabolism also suggests potential drug-drug interactions [see Drug Interactions ( 7.1 )] . Excretion Approximately 64% of a 30-mg oral solution dose of paroxetine was excreted in the urine with 2% as the parent compound and 62% as metabolites over a 10-day post-dosing period.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in rodents given paroxetine in the diet at 1, 5, and 25 mg/kg/day (mice) and 1, 5, and 20 mg/kg/day (rats). These doses are up to approximately 1.6 (mouse) and 2.5 (rat) times the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. There was a significantly greater number of male rats in the high-dose group with reticulum cell sarcomas (1/100, 0/50, 0/50, and 4/50 for control, low-, middle-, and high-dose groups, respectively) and a significantly increased linear trend across dose groups for the occurrence of lymphoreticular tumors in male rats. Female rats were not affected. Although there was a dose-related increase in the number of tumors in mice, there was no drug-related increase in the number of mice with tumors. The relevance of these findings to humans is unknown. Mutagenesis Paroxetine produced no genotoxic effects in a battery of 5 in vitro and 2 in vivo assays that included the following: Bacterial mutation assay, mouse lymphoma mutation assay, unscheduled DNA synthesis assay, and tests for cytogenetic aberrations in vivo in mouse bone marrow and in vitro in human lymphocytes and in a dominant lethal test in rats. Impairment of Fertility A reduced pregnancy rate was found in reproduction studies in rats at a dose of paroxetine of 15 mg/kg/day, which is approximately twice the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis. Irreversible lesions occurred in the reproductive tract of male rats after dosing in toxicity studies for 2 to 52 weeks. These lesions consisted of vacuolation of epididymal tubular epithelium at 50 mg/kg/day and atrophic changes in the seminiferous tubules of the testes with arrested spermatogenesis at 25 mg/kg/day (approximately 6 and 3 times the MRHD on an mg/m 2 basis)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Major Depressive Disorder The efficacy of Paroxetine as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) was established in two 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose studies with Paroxetine (Study 1 and Study 2) in adult patients who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV criteria for MDD. Study 1 and 2 included patients 18 to 65 years old who received Paroxetine doses of 25 to 62.5 mg/day (N= 212) or placebo (N= 211) once daily compared to immediate-release paroxetine 20 to 50 mg (N=217). A third 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, flexible dose study with Paroxetine (Study 3) included elderly patients, ranging in age from 60 to 88 years old and used Paroxetine doses of 12.5 to 50 mg/day (N=104) or placebo (N=109) once daily compared to immediate-release paroxetine 10 to 40 mg (N=106). In all three studies, Paroxetine was statistically superior to placebo in improving depressive symptoms as measured by the following: the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) total score at Week 12, the mean change from baseline in the Hamilton Depressed Mood item score at Week 12, and the mean change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)\u2013Severity of Illness score. Long-term efficacy of paroxetine for treatment of MDD in outpatients was established with one randomized withdrawal study with immediate-release paroxetine. Patients who responded to immediate-release paroxetine (HDRS total score <8) during an initial 8-week open-label treatment phase were then randomized to continue immediate-release paroxetine or placebo, for up to 1 year. Patients treated with immediate-release paroxetine demonstrated a statistically significant lower relapse rate during the withdrawal phase (15%) compared to those on placebo (39%). Effectiveness was similar for male and female patients. 14.2 Panic Disorder The effectiveness of Paroxetine in the treatment of panic disorder (PD) was evaluated in three 10-week, multicenter, flexible-dose studies (Studies 4, 5, and 6) comparing Paroxetine (12.5 to 75 mg daily) to placebo in adult outpatients 19 to 72 years of age who met panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) criteria according to DSM-IV. These trials were assessed on the basis of their outcomes on 3 variables: (1) the proportions of patients free of full panic attacks at Week 10; (2) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median number of full panic attacks; and (3) change from baseline to Week 10 in the median Clinical Global Impression Severity score. For Studies 4 and 5, Paroxetine was superior to placebo on 2 of these 3 variables. Study 6 failed to consistently demonstrate a statistically significant difference between Paroxetine and placebo on any of these variables. For all 3 studies, the mean dose of Paroxetine for completers at Week 10 was approximately 50 mg/day. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age or gender. Long-term maintenance effects of paroxetine in patients with PD were demonstrated in a randomized-withdrawal study using immediate-release paroxetine. Patients who were responders during a 10-week, double-blind trial (followed by a 3-month double-blind maintenance phase) of immediate-release paroxetine were re-randomized to continue immediate-release paroxetine or placebo in a 3-month, double-blind withdrawal phase. Patients randomized to immediate-release paroxetine were statistically significantly less likely to relapse than placebo-treated patients. 14.3 Social Anxiety Disorder The efficacy of Paroxetine as a treatment for social anxiety disorder (SAD) was established, in part, on the basis of extrapolation from the established effectiveness of immediate-release paroxetine in the treatment of SAD. In addition, the effectiveness of Paroxetine in the treatment of SAD was demonstrated in one 12-week, multicenter, double-blind, flexible-dose, placebo-controlled study of adult outpatients with a primary diagnosis of SAD by DSM-IV criteria (Study 7). In Study 7, the effectiveness of Paroxetine (12.5 to 37.5 mg daily) compared to placebo was evaluated on the basis of (1) change from baseline in the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) total score at Week 12 and (2) the proportion of responders who scored 1 or 2 (very much improved or much improved) on the CGI Global Improvement score at Week 12. In Study 7, Paroxetine demonstrated statistically significant superiority over placebo on both the change on LSAS total score at Week 12 and the CGI Improvement responder criterion at Week 12. For patients who completed the trial, 64% of patients treated with Paroxetine compared to 35% of patients treated with placebo were CGI Improvement responders at Week 12. Subgroup analyses did not indicate that there were any differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender. Subgroup analyses of studies utilizing the immediate-release formulation of paroxetine generally did not indicate differences in treatment outcomes as a function of age, race, or gender. 14.4 Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder The effectiveness of Paroxetine for the treatment of Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) utilizing a continuous dosing regimen has been established in 2 placebo-controlled trials in female patients ages 18 to 46 (Studies 8 and 9 [N=672]). Patients in these trials met DSM-IV criteria for PMDD. Of 1,030 patients including Study 10, who were treated with daily doses of Paroxetine 12.5 or 25 mg/day, or placebo continuously throughout the menstrual cycle for a period of 3 menstrual cycles, the mean duration of the PMDD symptoms was approximately 11 \u00b1 7 years. Patients on systemic hormonal contraceptives were excluded from these trials. Therefore, the efficacy of Paroxetine in combination with systemic (including oral) hormonal contraceptives for the continuous daily treatment of PMDD is unknown. The VAS score is a patient-rated instrument that mirrors the diagnostic criteria of PMDD as identified in the DSM-IV, and includes assessments for mood, physical symptoms, and other symptoms associated with PMDD. In Studies 8 and 9, 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine were statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to Month 3 on the luteal phase VAS score. In an additional study employing luteal phase dosing (Study 11), patients (N = 366) were treated for the 2 weeks prior to the onset of menses with 12.5 or 25 mg/day of Paroxetine or placebo for a period of 3 months. In this trial, 12.5 mg/day and 25 mg/day of Paroxetine, as luteal phase dosing, was statistically significantly more effective than placebo as measured by change from baseline to luteal phase VAS score at Month 3. There is insufficient information to determine the effect of race or age on outcome in Studies 8, 9, 10, and 11."

      "Dispense with Medication Guide available at: www.lannett.com/med-guide/paroxetine MEDICATION GUIDE Paroxetine (pa rox` e tine) Extended-Release Tablets, USP What is the most important information I should know about Paroxetine? Paroxetine can cause serious side effects, including: Increased risk of suicidal thoughts or actions. Antidepressant medicines may increase suicidal thoughts and actions in some children and young adults within the first few months of treatment or when the dose is changed. Paroxetine is not for use in people younger than 18 years of age. How can I watch for and try to prevent suicidal thoughts and actions? Depression or other serious mental illnesses are the most important causes of suicidal thoughts and actions. Pay close attention to any changes, especially sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts or feelings or if you develop suicidal thoughts or actions. This is very important when an antidepressant medicine is started or when the dose is changed. Call your healthcare provider right away to report new or sudden changes in mood, behavior, thoughts or feelings or if you develop suicidal thoughts or actions. Keep all follow-up visits with your healthcare provider as scheduled. Call your healthcare provider between visits as needed, especially if you have concerns about symptoms. Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if you have any of the following symptoms, especially if they are new, worse, or worry you: attempts to commit suicide acting aggressive or violent new or worse depression feeling agitated, restless, angry, or irritable an increase in activity and talking more than what is normal for you acting on dangerous impulses thoughts about suicide or dying new or worse anxiety or panic attacks trouble sleeping other unusual changes in behavior or mood What is Paroxetine? Paroxetine is a prescription medicine used in adults to treat: A certain type of depression called Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Panic Disorder Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) Do not take Paroxetine if you: take a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) have stopped taking an MAOI in the last 14 days are being treated with the antibiotic linezolid or intravenous methylene blue are taking thioridazine are taking pimozide are allergic to paroxetine or any of the ingredients in Paroxetine.

Paroxetine may harm your unborn baby. Taking Paroxetine during your first trimester of pregnancy may cause your baby to be at an increased risk of having a heart problem (cardiac malformations) at birth. Taking Paroxetine during your third trimester of pregnancy may cause your baby to have breathing, temperature, and feeding problems, low muscle tone (floppy baby syndrome), and irritability after birth and may cause your baby to be at an increased risk of a serious lung problem at birth. Talk to your healthcare provider about the risk to your unborn baby if you take Paroxetine during pregnancy. Tell your healthcare provider right away if you become pregnant or think you are pregnant during treatment with Paroxetine. There is a pregnancy registry for females who are exposed to Paroxetine during pregnancy. The purpose of the registry is to collect information about the health of females exposed to Paroxetine and their baby. If you become pregnant during treatment with Paroxetine talk to your healthcare provider about registering with the National Pregnancy Registry for Antidepressants at 1-866-961-2388 or visit online at https://womensmentalhealth.org/clinical-and-research-programs/pregnancyregistry/antidepressants/ . are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. Paroxetine passes into your breast milk. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to feed your baby during treatment with Paroxetine. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Paroxetine and some other medicines may affect each other causing possible serious side effects. Paroxetine may affect the way other medicines work and other medicines may affect the way Paroxetine works. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take: medicines used to treat migraine headaches called triptans tricyclic antidepressants lithium tramadol, fentanyl, meperidine, methadone, or other opioids tryptophan buspirone amphetamines St. John\u2019s Wort medicines that can affect blood clotting such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or warfarin diuretics tamoxifen Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if you are taking any of these medicines. Your healthcare provider can tell you if it is safe to take Paroxetine with your other medicines. Do not start or stop any other medicines during treatment with Paroxetine without talking to your healthcare provider first. Stopping Paroxetine suddenly may cause you to have serious side effects. See, \u201cWhat are the possible side effects of Paroxetine?\u201d Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them to show to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. How should I take Paroxetine? Take Paroxetine exactly as your healthcare provider tells you to. Your healthcare provider may need to change the dose of Paroxetine until it is the right dose for you. Take Paroxetine 1 time each day in the morning. Take Paroxetine with or without food. Swallow Paroxetine tablets whole. Do not chew or crush Paroxetine tablets. If you take too much Paroxetine, call your poison control center at 1-800-222-1222 or got to the nearest hospital emergency room right away. What are possible side effects of Paroxetine? Paroxetine can cause serious side effects, including: See, \u201cWhat is the most important information I should know about Paroxetine?\u201d Serotonin syndrome. A potentially life-threatening problem called serotonin syndrome can happen when you take Paroxetine with certain other medicines.
