      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate. Clinical Studies: Post-Operative Inflammation: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate is effective for the treatment of anterior chamber inflammation as measured by cell and flare. Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of giant papillary conjunctivitis after 1 week of treatment and continuing for up to 6 weeks while on treatment. Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis: A placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis during peak periods of pollen exposure. Uveitis: Controlled clinical studies of patients with uveitis demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was less effective than prednisolone acetate 1%. Overall, 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate experienced resolution of anterior chamber cell by day 28, compared to 87% of patients treated with 1% prednisolone acetate. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol etabonate is indicated for the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitides, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation. Loteprednol etabonate is less effective than prednisolone acetate 1% in two 28-day controlled clinical studies in acute anterior uveitis, where 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate experienced resolution of anterior chamber cells, compared to 87% of patients treated with prednisolone acetate 1%. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%. Loteprednol etabonate should not be used in patients who require a more potent corticosteroid for this indication. Loteprednol etabonate is also indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Loteprednol etabonate, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Loteprednol etabonate is also contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation and to other corticosteroids."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation."

      "PRECAUTIONS General Information for Patients This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If pain develops, redness, itching or inflammation becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, or in vivo in the single dose mouse micronucleus assay. Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (600 and 300 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C. Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (35 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at \u22655 mg/kg/day doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at \u226550 mg/kg/day) and embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses at 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with \u226550 mg/kg/day). Treatment of rats with 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum clinical dose) during organogenesis did not result in any reproductive toxicity. Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of \u22655 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 30 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 304 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 30 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg (4.9 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg (36 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg (73 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (30 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg (304 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg (608 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg (3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (3 times the clinical dose), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (30 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg (304 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 30 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 304 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 30 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg (4.9 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg (36 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg (73 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (30 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg (304 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg (608 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg (3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (3 times the clinical dose), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (30 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg (304 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg."

They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. While glucocorticoids are known to bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor, the molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor-dependent modulation of inflammation are not clearly established. However, corticosteroids are thought to inhibit prostaglandin production through several independent mechanisms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Loteprednol etabonate is lipid soluble and can penetrate into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to the inactive carboxylic acid metabolites, PJ-91 and PJ-90.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A2. Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate. Clinical Studies Post-Operative Inflammation : Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate is effective for the treatment of anterior chamber inflammation as measured by cell and flare. Uveitis: Controlled clinical studies of patients with uveitis demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was less effective than prednisolone acetate 1%. Overall, 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate experienced resolution of anterior chamber cell by day 28, compared to 87% of patients treated with 1% prednisolone acetate. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%. Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis : Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of giant papillary conjunctivitis after 1 week of treatment and continuing for up to 6 weeks while on treatment. Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis: A placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis during peak periods of pollen exposure."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is indicated for the treatment of steroid- responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitides, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is less effective than prednisolone acetate 1% in two 28-day controlled clinical studies in acute anterior uveitis, where 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension experienced resolution of anterior chamber cells, compared to 87% of patients treated with prednisolone acetate 1%. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension should not be used in patients who require a more potent corticosteroid for this indication. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is also indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Loteprednol etabonate as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Loteprednol etabonate is also contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation and to other corticosteroids."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients (see WARNINGS ). Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If pain develops, redness, itching or inflammation becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, three in vitro tests. In vivo evidence of genotoxicity, an increased frequency of micronucleated immature erythrocytes, was not observed in mice that received a single 4 gm/kg dose of loteprednol etabonate (50,000 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (600 and 300 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (35 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity; the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 50 or 100 mg/kg/day (600 and 1,200 times the maximum clinical dose) resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses with 100 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with 50 and 100 mg/kg/day); doses of 5 (60 times the maximum daily clinical dose), 50 and 100 mg/kg/day caused teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at all doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at 50 and 100 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 5 to 100 mg/kg/day but not at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The NOELs for the embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in rats were 5 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day (60 and 6 times the maximum daily clinical dose) for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity, respectively. Oral exposure of pregnant rats to 5 and 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate during the fetal period, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), resulted in teratogenicity (umbilical herniation) and embryotoxicity (decreased fetal birth weight); the NOEL for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. Oral treatment of female rats with 25 mg/kg/day (300 times the maximum daily clinical dose) from prior to mating through parturition increased the duration of gestation. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate. Clinical Studies: In two double-masked, placebo-controlled six-week environmental studies of 268 patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, loteprednol etabonate, when dosed four times per day was superior to placebo in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Loteprednol etabonate provided reduction in bulbar conjunctiva! injection and itching, beginning approximately 2 hours after instillation of the first dose and throughout the first 14 days of treatment."

      "WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If redness or itching becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Loteprednol etabonate should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in loteprednol etabonate, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling loteprednol etabonate before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, or in vivo in the single dose mouse micronucleus assay. Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (1500 and 750 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (85 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (15 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at \u22655 mg/kg/day doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at \u226550 mg/kg/day) and embryotoxicity (increased postimplantation losses at 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with \u226550 mg/kg/day). Treatment of rats with 0.5 mg/kg/day (15 times the maximum clinical dose) during organogenesis did not result in any reproductive toxicity. Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of \u22655 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

Ocular adverse reactions occurring in 5 to 15% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension (0.2%-0.5%) in clinical studies included abnormal vision/blurring, burning on instillation, chemosis, discharge, dry eyes, epiphora, foreign body sensation, itching, injection, and photophobia. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of patients include conjunctivitis, corneal abnormalities, eyelid erythema, keratoconjunctivitis, ocular irritation/pain/discomfort, papillae, and uveitis. Some of these events were similar to the underlying ocular disease being studied. Non-ocular adverse reactions occurred in less than 15% of patients. These include headache, rhinitis and pharyngitis. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mmHg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Among the smaller group of patients who were studied with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mm Hg) was 1 % (1/133) with loteprednol etabonate and 1 % (1/135) with placebo.

      "PRECAUTIONS General For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients (see WARNINGS). Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If pain develops, redness, itching or inflammation becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, three in vitro tests.In vivo evidence of genotoxicity, an increased frequency of micronucleated immature erythrocytes, was not observed in mice that received a single 4 gm/kg dose of loteprednol etabonate (50,000 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (600 and 300 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C. Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (35 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 50 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day (600 and 1,200 times the maximum clinical dose) resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses with 100 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day); doses of 5 mg/kg/day (60 times the maximum daily clinical dose), 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day caused teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at all doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 5 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day but not at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The NOELs for the embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in rats were 5 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day (60 and 6 times the maximum daily clinical dose) for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity, respectively. Oral exposure of pregnant rats to 5 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate during the fetal period, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), resulted in teratogenicity (umbilical herniation) and embryotoxicity (decreased fetal birth weight); the NOEL for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (< 1 ng/ml) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Clinical Studies In two double-masked, placebo-controlled six-week environmental studies of 268 patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, when dosed four times per day was superior to placebo in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension provided reduction in bulbar conjunctival injection and itching, beginning approximately 2 hours after instillation of the first dose and throughout the first 14 days of treatment."

Information for Patients This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If redness or itching becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes or in vivo in the single dose mouse micronucleus assay. Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (1,500 and 750 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (85 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (15 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 0.5 to 100 mg/kg/day resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses at 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with \u2265 50 mg/kg/day) and teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at \u2265 5 mg/kg/day doses and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at \u2265 50 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of \u2265 5 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period.

Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 0.5 to 100 mg/kg/day resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses at 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with \u2265 50 mg/kg/day) and teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at \u2265 5 mg/kg/day doses and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at \u2265 50 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of \u2265 5 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Clinical Studies Post-operative Inflammation: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is effective for the treatment of anterior chamber inflammation as measured by cell and flare. Uveitis: Controlled clinical studies of patients with uveitis demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was less effective than prednisolone acetate 1%. Overall, 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension experienced resolution of anterior chamber cell by day 28, compared to 87% of patients treated with 1% prednisolone acetate. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension and 6% with 1% prednisolone acetate. Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of giant papillary conjunctivitis after 1 week of treatment and continuing for up to 6 weeks while on treatment. Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis: A placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis during peak periods of pollen exposure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is indicated for the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitides, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is less effective than prednisolone acetate 1% in two 28-day controlled clinical studies in acute anterior uveitis, where 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension experienced resolution of anterior chamber cells, compared to 87% of patients treated with prednisolone acetate 1%. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension should not be used in patients who require a more potent corticosteroid for this indication. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is also indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is also contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation and to other corticosteroids."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients (see WARNINGS ). Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If pain develops, redness, itching or inflammation becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, three in vitro tests. In vivo evidence of genotoxicity, an increased frequency of micronucleated immature erythrocytes, was not observed in mice that received a single 4 gm/kg dose of loteprednol etabonate (50,000 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (600 and 300 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects. Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (35 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity; the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 50 or 100 mg/kg/day (600 and 1,200 times the maximum clinical dose) resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses with 100 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with 50 and 100 mg/kg/day); doses of 5 (60 times the maximum daily clinical dose), 50 and 100 mg/kg/day caused teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at all doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at 50 and 100 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 5 to 100 mg/kg/day but not at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The NOELs for the embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in rats were 5 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day (60 and 6 times the maximum daily clinical dose) for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity, respectively. Oral exposure of pregnant rats to 5 and 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate during the fetal period, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), resulted in teratogenicity (umbilical herniation) and embryotoxicity (decreased fetal birth weight); the NOEL for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. Oral treatment of female rats with 25 mg/kg/day (300 times the maximum daily clinical dose) from prior to mating through parturition increased the duration of gestation. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Clinical Studies: In two double-masked, placebo-controlled six-week environmental studies of 268 patients with seasonal allergic conjunctivitis, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, when dosed four times per day was superior to placebo in the treatment of the signs and symptoms of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension provided reduction in bulbar conjunctival injection and itching, beginning approximately 2 hours after instillation of the first dose and throughout the first 14 days of treatment."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients: This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If redness or itching becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red , should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, or in vivo in the single dose mouse micronucleus assay. Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (1,500 and 750 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (85 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (15 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 0.5 to 100 mg/kg/day resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses at 100 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with \u226550 mg/kg/day) and teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at \u22655 mg/kg/day doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at \u226550 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of \u22655 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

Ocular adverse reactions occurring in 5-15% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension (0.2-0.5%) in clinical studies included abnormal vision/blurring, burning on instillation, chemosis, discharge, dry eyes, epiphora, foreign body sensation, itching, injection, and photophobia. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of patients include conjunctivitis, corneal abnormalities, eyelid erythema, keratoconjunctivitis, ocular irritation/pain/discomfort, papillae, and uveitis. Some of these events were similar to the underlying ocular disease being studied. Non-ocular adverse reactions occurred in less than 15% of patients. These include headache, rhinitis and pharyngitis. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Among the smaller group of patients who were studied with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, the incidence of clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mm Hg) was 1% (1/133) with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension and 1% (1/135) with placebo.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension 0.5%/0.3% is a topical anti-infective and corticosteroid combination for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product (tobramycin) is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae , Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae , and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension is a combination of loteprednol etabonate, a corticosteroid, and tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase : Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored. ( 5.1 ) Cataracts : Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. ( 5.2 ) Delayed Healing : The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of a magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. ( 5.3 ) Bacterial Infections : Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infection. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension 0.5%/0.3% In a 42-day safety study comparing Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension to placebo, ocular adverse reactions included injection (approximately 20%) and superficial punctate keratitis (approximately 15%). Increased intraocular pressure was reported in 10% (Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension) and 4% (placebo) of subjects. Nine percent (9%) of Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension subjects reported burning and stinging upon instillation. Ocular reactions reported with an incidence less than 4% include vision disorders, discharge, itching, lacrimation disorder, photophobia, corneal deposits, ocular discomfort, eyelid disorder, and other unspecified eye disorders. The incidence of non-ocular reactions reported in approximately 14% of subjects was headache; all other non-ocular reactions had an incidence of less than 5%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.2% - 0.5% Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with infrequent optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, delayed wound healing and secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% The most frequent adverse reactions to topical tobramycin are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. Similar reactions may occur with the topical use of other aminoglycoside antibiotics. Secondary Infection The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 13 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 1.3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 135 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 13 times the RHOD. Abortions were observed in pregnant rabbits administered tobramycin via subcutaneous injection at 180 times the RHOD. Tobramycin did not affect fetal development when administered by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats at doses 450 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of loteprednol etabonate). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg/day (32 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (270 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rabbits administered 20 or 40 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions and maternal toxicity (renal nephrosis and cortical tubular necrosis) were observed at both dose levels. The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension. 8.4 Pediatric Use Two trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension in pediatric subjects age zero to six years; one was in subjects with lid inflammation and the other was in subjects with blepharoconjunctivitis. In the lid inflammation trial, Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension with warm compresses did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle with warm compresses. Patients received warm compress lid treatment plus Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension or vehicle for 14 days. The majority of patients in both treatment groups showed reduced lid inflammation. In the blepharoconjunctivitis trial, Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, or tobramycin ophthalmic solution. There was no difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline blepharoconjunctivitis score at Day 15. There were no differences in safety assessments between the treatment groups in either trial. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. The anti-infective component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae . Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius , Moraxella lacunata , Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a controlled clinical study of ocular penetration, the levels of loteprednol etabonate in the aqueous humor were found to be comparable between LOTEMAX \u00ae and Loteprednol Etabonate and Tobramycin Ophthalmic Suspension treatment groups. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with 0.5% loteprednol etabonate."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients: This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If redness or itching becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. Patients should be advised not to wear a contact lens if their eye is red. Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.2% should not be used to treat contact lens related irritation. The preservative in Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.2%, benzalkonium chloride, may be absorbed by soft contact lenses. Patients who wear soft contact lenses and whose eyes are not red, should be instructed to wait at least ten minutes after instilling Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.2% before they insert their contact lenses. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, or in vivo in the single dose mouse micronucleus assay. Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (1,500 and 750 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (85 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (15 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at \u22655 mg/kg/day doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at \u226550 mg/kg/day) and embryotoxicity (increased postimplantation losses at 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with \u226550 mg/kg/day). Treatment of rats with 0.5 mg/kg/day (15 times the maximum clinical dose) during organogenesis did not result in any reproductive toxicity. Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of \u22655 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.2% should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.2% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. Ocular adverse reactions occurring in 5-15% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension (0.2-0.5%) in clinical studies included abnormal vision/blurring, burning on instillation, chemosis, discharge, dry eyes, epiphora, foreign body sensation, itching, injection, and photophobia. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of patients include conjunctivitis, corneal abnormalities, eyelid erythema, keratoconjunctivitis, ocular irritation/pain/discomfort, papillae, and uveitis. Some of these events were similar to the underlying ocular disease being studied. Non-ocular adverse reactions occurred in less than 15% of patients. These include headache, rhinitis and pharyngitis. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Among the smaller group of patients who were studied with Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.2%, the incidence of clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mm Hg) was 1% (1/133) with Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Suspension, 0.2% and 1% (1/135) with placebo.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 30 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 304 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 30 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg (4.9 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg (36 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg (73 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (30 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg (304 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg (608 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg (3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (3 times the clinical dose), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (30 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg (304 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for LOTEMAX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LOTEMAX. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LOTEMAX have been established in the pediatric population. Use of LOTEMAX in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of LOTEMAX in adults with additional data from a safety and efficacy trial in pediatric patients from birth to 11 years of age [see Clinical Studies (14) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. While glucocorticoids are known to bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor, the molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor\u2011dependent modulation of inflammation are not clearly established. However, corticosteroids are thought to inhibit prostaglandin production through several independent mechanisms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Loteprednol etabonate is lipid soluble and can penetrate into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to the inactive carboxylic acid metabolites, PJ-91 and PJ-90. The systemic exposure to loteprednol etabonate following ocular administration of Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel has not been studied in humans."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Adult Studies In two randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled studies in 813 subjects with post-operative inflammation, Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel was more effective compared to its vehicle in resolving anterior chamber inflammation and pain following cataract surgery. Primary endpoints were complete resolution of anterior chamber cells (cell count of 0) and no pain at post-operative day 8. In these studies, Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel had a statistically significant higher incidence of subjects with complete clearing of anterior chamber cells (31% vs. 14-16%) and were pain-free at post-operative day 8 (73-76% vs. 42-46%). Pediatric Study The safety and effectiveness of Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel were evaluated in a pediatric study of patients from birth to less than 11 years of age (mean age of 3 years) undergoing cataract surgery. Patients were randomized to receive either Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel (54 patients) or prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension 1% (53 patients) four times daily for 14 days. At Day 14, the percentages of patients with complete clearing of anterior chamber inflammation were 57% in the Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel group and 63% in the prednisolone group."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% is a topical anti- infective and corticosteroid combination for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product (tobramycin) is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae, and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species . LOTEPREDNOL ETABONATE and TOBRAMYCIN ophthalmic suspension is a combination of loteprednol etabonate, a corticosteroid, and tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored. ( 5.1 ) Cataracts: Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. ( 5.2 ) Delayed Healing: The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of a magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. ( 5.3 ) Bacterial Infections: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infection. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Viral Infections: Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). (5.5) Fungal Infections: Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. 5.2 Cataracts Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. 5.3 Delayed Healing The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification such as a slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. 5.4 Bacterial Infections Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections.

Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). 5.6 Fungal Infections Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. 5.7 Aminoglycoside Hypersensitivity Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. If hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. 5.8 Risk of Contamination Do not allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. 5.9 Contact Lens Wear As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% In a 42-day safety study comparing loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% to placebo, ocular adverse reactions included injection (approximately 20%) and superficial punctate keratitis (approximately 15%). Increased intraocular pressure was reported in 10% (loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%) and 4% (placebo) of subjects. Nine percent (9%) of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%subjects reported burning and stinging upon instillation. Ocular reactions reported with an incidence less than 4% include vision disorders, discharge, itching, lacrimation disorder, photophobia, corneal deposits, ocular discomfort, eyelid disorder, and other unspecified eye disorders. The incidence of non-ocular reactions reported in approximately 14% of subjects was headache; all other non-ocular reactions had an incidence of less than 5%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.2% - 0.5% Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with infrequent optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, delayed wound healing and secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% The most frequent adverse reactions to topical tobramycin are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. Similar reactions may occur with the topical use of other aminoglycoside antibiotics. Secondary Infection The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Most common adverse reactions reported in patients were injection and superficial punctate keratitis, increased intraocular pressure, burning and stinging upon instillation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 13 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 1.3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 135 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 13 times the RHOD. Abortions were observed in pregnant rabbits administered tobramycin via subcutaneous injection at 180 times the RHOD. Tobramycin did not affect fetal development when administered by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats at doses 450 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data: Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of loteprednol etabonate). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg/day (32 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (270 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rabbits administered 20 or 40 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions and maternal toxicity (renal nephrosis and cortical tubular necrosis) were observed at both dose levels. The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%. 8.4 Pediatric Use Two trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% in pediatric subjects age zero to six years; one was in subjects with lid inflammation and the other was in subjects with blepharoconjunctivitis. In the lid inflammation trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% with warm compresses did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle with warm compresses. Patients received warm compress lid treatment plus loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% or vehicle for 14 days. The majority of patients in both treatment groups showed reduced lid inflammation. In the blepharoconjunctivitis trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, or tobramycin ophthalmic solution. There was no difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline blepharoconjunctivitis score at Day 15. There were no differences in safety assessments between the treatment groups in either trial. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. The anti-infective component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a controlled clinical study of ocular penetration, the levels of loteprednol etabonate in the aqueous humor were found to be comparable between loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5% and loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% treatment groups. . Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with 0.5% loteprednol etabonate."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% is a topical anti- infective and corticosteroid combination for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists. Ocular steroids are indicated in inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, and where the inherent risk of steroid use in certain infective conjunctivitides is accepted to obtain a diminution in edema and inflammation. They are also indicated in chronic anterior uveitis and corneal injury from chemical, radiation or thermal burns, or penetration of foreign bodies. The use of a combination drug with an anti-infective component is indicated where the risk of superficial ocular infection is high or where there is an expectation that potentially dangerous numbers of bacteria will be present in the eye. The particular anti-infective drug in this product (tobramycin) is active against the following common bacterial eye pathogens: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae, and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species . LOTEPREDNOL ETABONATE and TOBRAMYCIN ophthalmic suspension is a combination of loteprednol etabonate, a corticosteroid, and tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibacterial, indicated for steroid-responsive inflammatory ocular conditions for which a corticosteroid is indicated and where superficial bacterial ocular infection or a risk of bacterial ocular infection exists."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, IOP should be monitored. ( 5.1 ) Cataracts: Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. ( 5.2 ) Delayed Healing: The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of a magnification such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. ( 5.3 ) Bacterial Infections: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infection. In acute purulent conditions, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after 2 days, the patient should be re-evaluated. ( 5.4 ) Viral Infections: Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). (5.5) Fungal Infections: Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Intraocular Pressure (IOP) Increase Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored. 5.2 Cataracts Use of corticosteroids may result in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. 5.3 Delayed Healing The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification such as a slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. 5.4 Bacterial Infections Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections.

Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. 5.7 Aminoglycoside Hypersensitivity Sensitivity to topically applied aminoglycosides may occur in some patients. If hypersensitivity develops with this product, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. 5.8 Risk of Contamination Do not allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. 5.9 Contact Lens Wear As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Adverse reactions have occurred with steroid/anti-infective combination drugs which can be attributed to the steroid component, the anti-infective component, or the combination. Loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% In a 42-day safety study comparing loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% to placebo, ocular adverse reactions included injection (approximately 20%) and superficial punctate keratitis (approximately 15%). Increased intraocular pressure was reported in 10% (loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%) and 4% (placebo) of subjects. Nine percent (9%) of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%subjects reported burning and stinging upon instillation. Ocular reactions reported with an incidence less than 4% include vision disorders, discharge, itching, lacrimation disorder, photophobia, corneal deposits, ocular discomfort, eyelid disorder, and other unspecified eye disorders. The incidence of non-ocular reactions reported in approximately 14% of subjects was headache; all other non-ocular reactions had an incidence of less than 5%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.2% - 0.5% Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with infrequent optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, delayed wound healing and secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mm Hg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo. Tobramycin ophthalmic solution 0.3% The most frequent adverse reactions to topical tobramycin are hypersensitivity and localized ocular toxicity, including lid itching and swelling and conjunctival erythema. These reactions occur in less than 4% of patients. Similar reactions may occur with the topical use of other aminoglycoside antibiotics. Secondary Infection The development of secondary infection has occurred after use of combinations containing steroids and antimicrobials. Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term applications of steroids. The possibility of fungal invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where steroid treatment has been used. Secondary bacterial ocular infection following suppression of host responses also occurs. Most common adverse reactions reported in patients were injection and superficial punctate keratitis, increased intraocular pressure, burning and stinging upon instillation.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 13 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 1.3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 135 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 13 times the RHOD. Abortions were observed in pregnant rabbits administered tobramycin via subcutaneous injection at 180 times the RHOD. Tobramycin did not affect fetal development when administered by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats at doses 450 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data: Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of loteprednol etabonate). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg/day (32 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (270 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rabbits administered 20 or 40 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions and maternal toxicity (renal nephrosis and cortical tubular necrosis) were observed at both dose levels. The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD). 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3%. 8.4 Pediatric Use Two trials were conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% in pediatric subjects age zero to six years; one was in subjects with lid inflammation and the other was in subjects with blepharoconjunctivitis. In the lid inflammation trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% with warm compresses did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle with warm compresses. Patients received warm compress lid treatment plus loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% or vehicle for 14 days. The majority of patients in both treatment groups showed reduced lid inflammation. In the blepharoconjunctivitis trial, loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% did not demonstrate efficacy compared to vehicle, loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, or tobramycin ophthalmic solution. There was no difference between treatment groups in mean change from baseline blepharoconjunctivitis score at Day 15. There were no differences in safety assessments between the treatment groups in either trial. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate or tobramycin in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 13 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 1.3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 135 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 13 times the RHOD. Abortions were observed in pregnant rabbits administered tobramycin via subcutaneous injection at 180 times the RHOD. Tobramycin did not affect fetal development when administered by subcutaneous injection to pregnant rats at doses 450 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data: Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day (0.54 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of loteprednol etabonate). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg/day, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg/day (2.1 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg/day (16 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg/day (32 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg/day (270 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (1.3 times the RHOD), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg/day (13 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg/day (135 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg/day. An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rabbits administered 20 or 40 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions and maternal toxicity (renal nephrosis and cortical tubular necrosis) were observed at both dose levels. The developmental and maternal lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) is 20 mg/kg/day (180 times the RHOD based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption of tobramycin). An embryofetal study was conducted in pregnant rats administered 50 or 100 mg/kg/day tobramycin by subcutaneous injection on gestational days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. No effects on development, reproduction, or maternal toxicity were reported. The developmental and maternal NOAEL is 100 mg/kg/day (450 times the RHOD)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. The anti-infective component in the combination (tobramycin) is included to provide action against susceptible organisms. In vitro studies have demonstrated that tobramycin is active against susceptible strains of the following microorganisms: Staphylococci, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis (coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative), including penicillin-resistant strains. Streptococci, including some of the Group A-beta-hemolytic species, some nonhemolytic species, and some Streptococcus pneumoniae. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii , most Proteus vulgaris strains, Haemophilus influenzae and H. aegyptius, Moraxella lacunata, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and some Neisseria species. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In a controlled clinical study of ocular penetration, the levels of loteprednol etabonate in the aqueous humor were found to be comparable between loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5% and loteprednol etabonate and tobramycin ophthalmic suspension, 0.5%/0.3% treatment groups. . Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with 0.5% loteprednol etabonate."

Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 30 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 304 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 30 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. However, the background risk in the U.S. general population of major birth defects is 2 to 4%, and of miscarriage is 15 to 20%, of clinically recognized pregnancies. Data Animal Data Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 18, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg (1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) based on body surface area, assuming 100% absorption). Spina bifida (including meningocele) was observed at doses \u2265 0.1 mg/kg, and exencephaly and craniofacial malformations were observed at doses \u2265 0.4 mg/kg (4.9 times the RHOD). At 3 mg/kg (36 times the RHOD), loteprednol etabonate was associated with increased incidences of abnormal left common carotid artery, limb flexures, umbilical hernia, scoliosis, and delayed ossification. Abortion and embryofetal lethality (resorption) occurred at doses \u2265 6 mg/kg (73 times the RHOD). A NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity in rabbits was 3 mg/kg/day. Embryofetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage on gestation days 6 to 15, to target the period of organogenesis. Loteprednol etabonate produced fetal malformations, including absent innominate artery at doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (30 times the RHOD); and cleft palate, agnathia, cardiovascular defects, umbilical hernia, decreased fetal body weight and decreased skeletal ossification at doses \u2265 50 mg/kg (304 times the RHOD). Embryofetal lethality (resorption) was observed at 100 mg/kg (608 times the RHOD). The NOAEL for developmental toxicity in rats was 0.5 mg/kg (3 times the RHOD). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (reduced body weight gain) at doses of \u2265 50 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg. A peri-/postnatal study was conducted in rats administered loteprednol etabonate by oral gavage from gestation day 15 (start of fetal period) to postnatal day 21 (the end of lactation period). At doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg (3 times the clinical dose), reduced survival was observed in live-born offspring. Doses \u2265 5 mg/kg (30 times the RHOD) caused umbilical hernia/incomplete gastrointestinal tract. Doses \u2265 50 mg/kg (304 times the RHOD) produced maternal toxicity (reduced body weight gain, death), decreased number of live-born offspring, decreased birth weight, and delays in postnatal development. A developmental NOAEL was not established in this study. The NOAEL for maternal toxicity was 5 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation There are no data on the presence of loteprednol etabonate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered, along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for LOTEMAX and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from LOTEMAX. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of LOTEMAX have been established in the pediatric population. Use of LOTEMAX in this population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled trials of LOTEMAX in adults with additional data from a safety and efficacy trial in pediatric patients from birth to 11 years of age [see Clinical Studies ( 14 )]. 8.5 Geriatric Use No overall differences in safety and effectiveness have been observed between elderly and younger patients."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with loteprednol etabonate in pregnant women. Loteprednol etabonate produced teratogenicity at clinically relevant doses in the rabbit and rat when administered orally during pregnancy. Loteprednol etabonate produced malformations when administered orally to pregnant rabbits at doses \u2265 1.2 times the recommended human ophthalmic dose (RHOD) and to pregnant rats at doses \u2265 30 times the RHOD. In pregnant rats receiving oral doses of loteprednol etabonate during the period equivalent to the last trimester of pregnancy through lactation in humans, survival of offspring was reduced at doses \u2265 3 times the RHOD. Maternal toxicity was observed in rats at doses \u2265 304 times the RHOD, and a maternal no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was established at 30 times the RHOD. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown.

They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. While glucocorticoids are known to bind to and activate the glucocorticoid receptor, the molecular mechanisms involved in glucocorticoid/glucocorticoid receptor\u2011dependent modulation of inflammation are not clearly established. However, corticosteroids are thought to inhibit prostaglandin production through several independent mechanisms. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Loteprednol etabonate is lipid soluble and can penetrate into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivoand in vitropreclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to the inactive carboxylic acid metabolites, PJ-91 and PJ-90.

Primary endpoints were complete resolution of anterior chamber cells (cell count of 0) and no pain at post-operative day 8. In these studies, Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel had a statistically significant higher incidence of subjects with complete clearing of anterior chamber cells (31% vs. 14-16%) and were pain-free at post-operative day 8 (73-76% vs. 42-46%). Pediatric Study The safety and effectiveness of Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel were evaluated in a pediatric study of patients from birth to less than 11 years of age (mean age of 3 years) undergoing cataract surgery. Patients were randomized to receive either Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel (54 patients) or prednisolone acetate ophthalmic suspension 1% (53 patients) four times daily for 14 days. At Day 14, the percentages of patients with complete clearing of anterior chamber inflammation were 57% in the Loteprednol Etabonate Ophthalmic Gel group and 63% in the prednisolone group."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (< 1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Clinical Studies Post-operative Inflammation: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is effective for the treatment of anterior chamber inflammation as measured by cell and flare. Uveitis: Controlled clinical studies of patients with uveitis demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was less effective than prednisolone acetate 1%. Overall, 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension experienced resolution of anterior chamber cell by day 28, compared to 87% of patients treated with 1% prednisolone acetate. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u2265 10 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension and 6% with 1% prednisolone acetate. Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of giant papillary conjunctivitis after 1 week of treatment and continuing for up to 6 weeks while on treatment. Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis: A placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis during peak periods of pollen exposure."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is indicated for the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitides, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is less effective than prednisolone acetate 1% in two 28-day controlled clinical studies in acute anterior uveitis, where 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension experienced resolution of anterior chamber cells, compared to 87% of patients treated with prednisolone acetate 1%. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u2265 10 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension should not be used in patients who require a more potent corticosteroid for this indication. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is also indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia and varicella and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is also contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation and to other corticosteroids."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients (see WARNINGS ). Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If pain develops, redness, itching or inflammation becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, three in vitro tests. In vivo evidence of genotoxicity, an increased frequency of micronucleated immature erythrocytes, was not observed in mice that received a single 4 gm/kg dose of loteprednol etabonate (50,000 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (600 and 300 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (35 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity; the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 50 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day (600 and 1,200 times the maximum clinical dose) resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses with 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day); doses of 5 (60 times the maximum daily clinical dose), 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day caused teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at all doses and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 5 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day but not at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The NOELs for the embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in rats were 5 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day (60 and 6 times the maximum daily clinical dose) for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity, respectively. Oral exposure of pregnant rats to 5 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate during the fetal period, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), resulted in teratogenicity (umbilical herniation) and embryotoxicity (decreased fetal birth weight); the NOEL for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. Oral treatment of female rats with 25 mg/kg/day (300 times the maximum daily clinical dose) from prior to mating through parturition increased the duration of gestation. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (35 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity; the no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 50 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day (600 and 1,200 times the maximum clinical dose) resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses with 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day); doses of 5 (60 times the maximum daily clinical dose), 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day caused teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at all doses and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 5 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day but not at 0.5 mg/kg/day. The NOELs for the embryotoxic and teratogenic effects in rats were 5 mg/kg/day and 0.5 mg/kg/day (60 and 6 times the maximum daily clinical dose) for embryotoxicity and teratogenicity, respectively. Oral exposure of pregnant rats to 5 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate during the fetal period, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), resulted in teratogenicity (umbilical herniation) and embryotoxicity (decreased fetal birth weight); the NOEL for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. Oral treatment of female rats with 25 mg/kg/day (300 times the maximum daily clinical dose) from prior to mating through parturition increased the duration of gestation."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure. Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivo and in vitro preclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension."

      "CLINICAL STUDIES: Post-operative Inflammation: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is effective for the treatment of anterior chamber inflammation as measured by cell and flare. Uveitis: Controlled clinical studies of patients with uveitis demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was less effective than prednisolone acetate 1%. Overall, 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension experienced resolution of anterior chamber cell by day 28, compared to 87% of patients treated with 1% prednisolone acetate. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%. Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of giant papillary conjunctivitis after 1 week of treatment and continuing for up to 6 weeks while on treatment. Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis: A placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis during peak periods of pollen exposure."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE: Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is indicated for the treatment of steroid responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitides, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is less effective than prednisolone acetate 1% in two 28-day controlled clinical studies in acute anterior uveitis, where 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension experienced resolution of anterior chamber cells, compared to 87% of patients treated with prednisolone acetate 1%. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension should not be used in patients who require a more potent corticosteroid for this indication. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is also indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: General: For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients (see WARNINGS). Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients: Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If pain develops, redness, itching or inflammation becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension. Carcinogenesis,Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, three in vitro tests. In vivo evidence of genotoxicity, an increased frequency of micronucleated immature erythrocytes, was not observed in mice that received a single 4 gm/kg dose of loteprednol etabonate (50,000 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (600 and 300 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender.

Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis with 50 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day (600 and 1,200 times the maximum clinical dose) resulted in embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses with 100 mg/kg/day, and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day); doses of 5 mg/kg/day (60 times the maximum daily clinical dose), 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day caused teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at all doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at 50 mg/kg/day and 100 mg/kg/day). Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of 5 mg/kg/day to 100 mg/kg/day but not at 0.5 mg/kg/day.

Oral exposure of pregnant rats to 5 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate during the fetal period, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), resulted in teratogenicity (umbilical herniation) and embryotoxicity (decreased fetal birth weight); the NOEL for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is administered to a nursing woman.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Corticosteroids inhibit the inflammatory response to a variety of inciting agents and probably delay or slow healing. They inhibit the edema, fibrin deposition, capillary dilation, leukocyte migration, capillary proliferation, fibroblast proliferation, deposition of collagen, and scar formation associated with inflammation. There is no generally accepted explanation for the mechanism of action of ocular corticosteroids. However, corticosteroids are thought to act by the induction of phospholipase A 2 inhibitory proteins, collectively called lipocortins. It is postulated that these proteins control the biosynthesis of potent mediators of inflammation such as prostaglandins and leukotrienes by inhibiting the release of their common precursor arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid is released from membrane phospholipids by phospholipase A 2 . Corticosteroids are capable of producing a rise in intraocular pressure (IOP). Loteprednol etabonate is structurally similar to other corticosteroids. However, the number 20 position ketone group is absent. It is highly lipid soluble which enhances its penetration into cells. Loteprednol etabonate is synthesized through structural modifications of prednisolone-related compounds so that it will undergo a predictable transformation to an inactive metabolite. Based upon in vivoand in vitropreclinical metabolism studies, loteprednol etabonate undergoes extensive metabolism to inactive carboxylic acid metabolites. Results from a bioavailability study in normal volunteers established that plasma levels of loteprednol etabonate and \u0394 1 cortienic acid etabonate (PJ 91), its primary, inactive metabolite, were below the limit of quantitation (1 ng/mL) at all sampling times. The results were obtained following the ocular administration of one drop in each eye of 0.5% loteprednol etabonate 8 times daily for 2 days or 4 times daily for 42 days. This study suggests that limited (<1 ng/mL) systemic absorption occurs with loteprednol etabonate. Clinical Studies: Post-Operative Inflammation : Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate is effective for the treatment of anterior chamber inflammation as measured by cell and flare. Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis: Placebo-controlled clinical studies demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of giant papillary conjunctivitis after 1 week of treatment and continuing for up to 6 weeks while on treatment. Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis: A placebo-controlled clinical study demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis during peak periods of pollen exposure. Uveitis: Controlled clinical studies of patients with uveitis demonstrated that loteprednol etabonate was less effective than prednisolone acetate 1%. Overall, 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate experienced resolution of anterior chamber cell by day 28, compared to 87% of patients treated with 1% prednisolone acetate. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is indicated for the treatment of steroid-responsive inflammatory conditions of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctiva, cornea and anterior segment of the globe such as allergic conjunctivitis, acne rosacea, superficial punctate keratitis, herpes zoster keratitis, iritis, cyclitis, selected infective conjunctivitides, when the inherent hazard of steroid use is accepted to obtain an advisable diminution in edema and inflammation. Loteprednol etabonate is less effective than prednisolone acetate 1% in two 28-day controlled clinical studies in acute anterior uveitis, where 72% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate experienced resolution of anterior chamber cells, compared to 87% of patients treated with prednisolone acetate 1%. The incidence of patients with clinically significant increases in IOP (\u226510 mmHg) was 1% with loteprednol etabonate and 6% with prednisolone acetate 1%. Loteprednol etabonate should not be used in patients who require a more potent corticosteroid for this indication. Loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension is also indicated for the treatment of post-operative inflammation following ocular surgery."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Loteprednol etabonate, as with other ophthalmic corticosteroids, is contraindicated in most viral diseases of the cornea and conjunctiva including epithelial herpes simplex keratitis (dendritic keratitis), vaccinia, and varicella, and also in mycobacterial infection of the eye and fungal diseases of ocular structures. Loteprednol etabonate is also contraindicated in individuals with known or suspected hypersensitivity to any of the ingredients of this preparation and to other corticosteroids."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in glaucoma with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of vision, and in posterior subcapsular cataract formation. Steroids should be used with caution in the presence of glaucoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical steroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, steroids may mask infection or enhance existing infection. Use of ocular steroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex). Employment of a corticosteroid medication in the treatment of patients with a history of herpes simplex requires great caution. The use of steroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and increase the incidence of bleb formation."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients (see WARNINGS ). Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate. Information for Patients: This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If pain develops, redness, itching or inflammation becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate suspension. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in vitroin the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, or in vivoin the single dose mouse micronucleus assay. Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (600 and 300 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (35 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at \u22655 mg/kg/day doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at \u226550 mg/kg/day) and embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses at 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with \u226550 mg/kg/day). Treatment of rats with 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum clinical dose) during organogenesis did not result in any reproductive toxicity. Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of \u22655 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether topical ophthalmic administration of corticosteroids could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in human milk. Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. Ocular adverse reactions occurring in 5%-15% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension (0.2%-0.5%) in clinical studies included abnormal vision/blurring, burning on instillation, chemosis, discharge, dry eyes, epiphora, foreign body sensation, itching, injection, and photophobia. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of patients include conjunctivitis, corneal abnormalities, eyelid erythema, keratoconjunctivitis, ocular irritation/pain/discomfort, papillae, and uveitis. Some of these events were similar to the underlying ocular disease being studied. Non-ocular adverse reactions occurred in less than 15% of patients. These include headache, rhinitis and pharyngitis. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mmHg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo.

Systemic steroids appear in human milk and could suppress growth, interfere with endogenous corticosteroid production, or cause other untoward effects. Caution should be exercised when loteprednol etabonate is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General: For ophthalmic use only. The initial prescription and renewal of the medication order beyond 14 days should be made by a physician only after examination of the patient with the aid of magnification, such as slit lamp biomicroscopy and, where appropriate, fluorescein staining. If signs and symptoms fail to improve after two days, the patient should be re-evaluated. If this product is used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should be monitored even though it may be difficult in children and uncooperative patients (see WARNINGS ). Fungal infections of the cornea are particularly prone to develop coincidentally with long-term local steroid application. Fungus invasion must be considered in any persistent corneal ulceration where a steroid has been used or is in use. Fungal cultures should be taken when appropriate."

    "information_for_patients": [
      "Information for Patients: This product is sterile when packaged. Patients should be advised not to allow the dropper tip to touch any surface, as this may contaminate the suspension. If pain develops, redness, itching or inflammation becomes aggravated, the patient should be advised to consult a physician. As with all ophthalmic preparations containing benzalkonium chloride, patients should be advised not to wear soft contact lenses when using loteprednol etabonate suspension."

      "Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies have not been conducted to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of loteprednol etabonate. Loteprednol etabonate was not genotoxic in vitro in the Ames test, the mouse lymphoma tk assay, or in a chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, or in vivo in the single dose mouse micronucleus assay. Treatment of male and female rats with up to 50 mg/kg/day and 25 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate, respectively, (600 and 300 times the maximum clinical dose, respectively) prior to and during mating did not impair fertility in either gender."

    "pregnancy": [
      "Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Loteprednol etabonate has been shown to be embryotoxic (delayed ossification) and teratogenic (increased incidence of meningocele, abnormal left common carotid artery, and limb flexures) when administered orally to rabbits during organogenesis at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day (35 times the maximum daily clinical dose), a dose which caused no maternal toxicity. The no-observed-effect-level (NOEL) for these effects was 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum daily clinical dose). Oral treatment of rats during organogenesis resulted in teratogenicity (absent innominate artery at \u22655 mg/kg/day doses, and cleft palate and umbilical hernia at \u226550 mg/kg/day) and embryotoxicity (increased post-implantation losses at 100 mg/kg/day and decreased fetal body weight and skeletal ossification with \u226550 mg/kg/day). Treatment of rats with 0.5 mg/kg/day (6 times the maximum clinical dose) during organogenesis did not result in any reproductive toxicity. Loteprednol etabonate was maternally toxic (significantly reduced body weight gain during treatment) when administered to pregnant rats during organogenesis at doses of \u22655 mg/kg/day. Oral exposure of female rats to 50 mg/kg/day of loteprednol etabonate from the start of the fetal period through the end of lactation, a maternally toxic treatment regimen (significantly decreased body weight gain), gave rise to decreased growth and survival, and retarded development in the offspring during lactation; the NOEL for these effects was 5 mg/kg/day. Loteprednol etabonate had no effect on the duration of gestation or parturition when administered orally to pregnant rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day during the fetal period."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Reactions associated with ophthalmic steroids include elevated intraocular pressure, which may be associated with optic nerve damage, visual acuity and field defects, posterior subcapsular cataract formation, secondary ocular infection from pathogens including herpes simplex, and perforation of the globe where there is thinning of the cornea or sclera. Ocular adverse reactions occurring in 5%-15% of patients treated with loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension (0.2%-0.5%) in clinical studies included abnormal vision/blurring, burning on instillation, chemosis, discharge, dry eyes, epiphora, foreign body sensation, itching, injection, and photophobia. Other ocular adverse reactions occurring in less than 5% of patients include conjunctivitis, corneal abnormalities, eyelid erythema, keratoconjunctivitis, ocular irritation/pain/discomfort, papillae, and uveitis. Some of these events were similar to the underlying ocular disease being studied. Non-ocular adverse reactions occurred in less than 15% of patients. These include headache, rhinitis and pharyngitis. In a summation of controlled, randomized studies of individuals treated for 28 days or longer with loteprednol etabonate, the incidence of significant elevation of intraocular pressure (\u226510 mmHg) was 2% (15/901) among patients receiving loteprednol etabonate, 7% (11/164) among patients receiving 1% prednisolone acetate and 0.5% (3/583) among patients receiving placebo.
