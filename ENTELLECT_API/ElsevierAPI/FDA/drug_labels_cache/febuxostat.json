      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gout Flares : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects : Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. ( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): Febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC\u221e. As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine(0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected.\\ Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: Febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: Febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . * Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study* Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. * Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and Cl cr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol* 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eClcr) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eClcr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

CV Death Inform patients that gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol in a CV outcomes study. Inform all patients of the higher rate of CV death with febuxostat compared to allopurinol. Alert all patients (those with and without CV disease) for the development of signs and symptoms of CV events and to seek medical care promptly should they occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Gout Flares Inform patients that after initiation of febuxostat an increase in gout flares can occur and that is not reason to stop taking the medication. Instruct patients that it is recommended to initiate and continue gout prophylaxis therapy for six months while taking febuxostat [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hepatic Effects Inform patients that hepatic effects, including fatal ones, have occurred in patients treated with febuxostat. Instruct them to inform their healthcare provider if they experience liver injury symptoms [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] .

The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablets are 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets are limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ].

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects : Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [ see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the prescribing information: Cardiovascular Death [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatic Effects [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Serious Skin Reactions [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions in > 1% of patients treated with febuxostat are liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Novadoz Pharmaceuticals LLC at 1-855-668-2369 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years.In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were 6 to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u2265 1 % of Patients Treated with Febuxostat and at Least 0.5% Greater than in Patients Receiving Placebo in Controlled Studies A d verse Reactions Placebo Febuxostat allopurinol* (N=134) 40 mg daily (N=757) 80 mg daily (N=1279) (N=1277) Liver Function Abnormalities 0.7% 6.6% 4.6% 4.2% Nausea 0.7% 1.1% 1.3% 0.8% Arthralgia 0% 1.1% 0.7% 0.7% Rash 0.7% 0.5% 1.6% 1.6% *Of the patients who received allopurinol, 10 received 100 mg, 145 received 200 mg, and 1122 received 300 mg, based on level of renal impairment. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy was liver function abnormalities in 1.8% of febuxostat 40 mg, 1.2% of febuxostat 80 mg, and in 0.9% of patients treated with allopurinol. In addition to the adverse reactions presented in Table 1, dizziness was reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo. In the CARES study, liver function abnormalities and diarrhea were reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat, although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than allopurinol.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1)], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients(\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients(\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of anti-hyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: Febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl Cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3 ). Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study* Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat Tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Gout Flares : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Effects : Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions : Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. ( 8.7 ) \u2022 Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): Febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary: Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data: Animal Data : In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary: There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data: Animal Data : Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption: The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution: The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism: Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination: Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations: Geriatric Patients : The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment : In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients: Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups : No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies: Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs : Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline : Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs : In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat : Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies: Azathioprine : Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline : No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine : No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen : No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin : No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide : No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin : No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine : Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian 80% African American 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit: Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit ( Table 3 ). Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) Allopurinol Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr\u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 300 mg daily (N=501) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eClcr) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eClcr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. (2.4 , 5.2) Hepatic Effects: Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.3) Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. (5.4) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat tablets were similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat tablets should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat tablets should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

(6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. at 1-800-818-4555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were 6 to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. (7) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. (8.7) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): Febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population.. (8.8) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 mL/min to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 mL/min to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1\u2011methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 mL/min to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 mL/min to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ].

Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a one year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4 week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656 mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after 2 weeks, the recommended dosage is 80 mg once daily. (2.1) Can be administered without regard to food or antacid use. (2.1) Limit the dosage of febuxostat tablets to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. (2.2, 8.6) 2.1 Recommended Dose The recommended febuxostat tablet dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablets is limited to 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.3 Uric Acid Level Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat tablets therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies (14.1)]. If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Death: In a CV outcomes study, there was a higher rate of CV death in patients treated with febuxostat tablets compared to allopurinol; in the same study febuxostat tablets was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Consider the risks and benefits of Febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on Febuxostat tablets. (1, 5.1) Gout Flares : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2) Hepatic Effects : Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01101035), gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. The CV outcomes study in patients with gout (CARES) was a randomized, double-blinded, allopurinol-controlled, non-inferiority study conducted to evaluate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with gout who were treated with febuxostat. The study enrolled patients who had a history of major CV disease, cerebrovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with micro-and/or macrovascular disease. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. Results showed that febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of MACE [Hazard Ratio: 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.89, 1.21]. However, there was a significant increase in CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 [1.5 per 100 patient-years]) compared to patients treated with allopurinol (100 [1.1 per 100 patient-years]) [Hazard Ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.73]. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat [see Indications and Usage (1)]. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse CV event signs and symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), febuxostat treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Febuxostat should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug- induced liver injury and should not be restarted on febuxostat. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with caution. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with caution in these patients."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the prescribing information: Cardiovascular Death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatic Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with febuxostat, and at least 0.5% greater than placebo, are liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Ascend Laboratories, LLC at 1-877-ASC-RX01 (877-272-7901) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were six to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo.

The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy was liver function abnormalities in 1.8% of febuxostat 40 mg, 1.2% of febuxostat 80 mg, and in 0.9% of patients treated with allopurinol. In addition to the adverse reactions presented in Table 1, dizziness was reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo. In the CARES study, liver function abnormalities and diarrhea were reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat, although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than allopurinol.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

(8.7) \u2022 No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients); therefore, febuxostat is not recommended for use in these patients. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in studies 1, 2 and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in treatment of gout) [(see Clinical Studies (14.1)], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The Cmax and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Clcr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C- labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Clcr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Clcr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Clcr 10 to 29 mL/min), the Cmax of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Clcr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean Cmax and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in Cmax and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C- labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Clcr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Clcr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Clcr 10 to 29 mL/min), the Cmax of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Clcr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean Cmax and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in Cmax and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Clcr) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00102440), a one year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a four week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study* Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) *Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this sub group of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol* 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) *Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat. The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eClcr) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eClcr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablets are 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets are limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat tablets therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Effects : Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [ see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years.In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were 6 to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

( 8.7 ) \u2022 Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1)], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients(\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of anti-hyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: Febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl Cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3 ). Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study* Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

(2.4) \u2022 Can be administered without regard to food or antacid use. (2.1) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablets is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] ."

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months.(2.4, 5.2) \u2022 Hepatic Effects: Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.3) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. (5.4) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat tablets were similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat tablets should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat tablets. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat tablets should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. (7) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

(8.8) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 mL/min to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 mL/min to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-\u00admethylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 mL/min to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 mL/min to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-\u00admethylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 ( NCT00430248 ) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 ( NCT00174915 ) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 ( NCT00102440 ), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4 week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat ( NCT01101035 ). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656 mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eClcr) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eClcr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u00b7 Gout Flares : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months.(2.4, 5.2) \u00b7 Hepatic Effects: Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.3) \u00b7 Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. (5.4) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat tablets were similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat tablets should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat tablets. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat tablets should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. (7) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u00b7 Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. (8.7) \u00b7 Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): Febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. (8.8) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 mL/min to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 mL/min to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies A zathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1\u00ad-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4 week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656 mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

CV Death Inform patients that gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol in a CV outcomes study. Inform all patients of the higher rate of CV death with febuxostat tablets compared to allopurinol. Alert all patients (those with and without CV disease) for the development of signs and symptoms of CV events and to seek medical care promptly should they occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] . Gout Flares Inform patients that after initiation of febuxostat tablets an increase in gout flares can occur and that is not reason to stop taking the medication. Instruct patients that it is recommended to initiate and continue gout prophylaxis therapy for six months while taking febuxostat tablets [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] .

Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )].

Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects: Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat, have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the prescribing information: Cardiovascular Death [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Hepatic Effects [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] Adverse reactions in \u2265 1% of patients treated with febuxostat are liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Viona Pharmaceuticals Inc. at 1-888-304-5011 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2,757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u2265 6 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1,377 patients were treated for \u2265 6 months, 674 patients were treated for \u2265 1 year and 515 patients were treated for \u2265 2 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u2265 1 year and 1539 were treated for \u2265 2 years [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] .

( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. ( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 - 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , 16 % were 65 and over, while 4 % were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hours mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hours mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hours mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 hours to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 hour and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1, (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are co administered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the co administration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hours mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hours mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hours mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 hours to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 hour and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1, (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are co administered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the co administration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u2265 8 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u2265 60 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u2265 30 mL/min and \u2264 59 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u2264 2 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4 week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies.

Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3 Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit * Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo.

Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u2265 10 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended febuxostat tablet dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after 2 weeks, the recommended dosage is 80 mg once daily. (2.1) Can be administered without regard to food or antacid use. (2.1) Limit the dosage of febuxostat tablet to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. (2.2, 8.6) 2.1 Recommended Dose The recommended febuxostat tablet dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablet is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablet dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablet is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.3 Uric Acid Level Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat tablets therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1)] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Death : In a CV outcomes study, there was a higher rate of CV death in patients treated with febuxostat tablets compared to allopurinol; in the same study febuxostat tablets was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat tablets. (1, 5.1) Gout Flares : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months. (2.4, 5.2) Hepatic Effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat tablets and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart febuxostat tablets if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.3) Serious Skin Reactions : Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected. (5.4) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01101035), gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. The CV outcomes study in patients with gout (CARES) was a randomized, double-blinded, allopurinol-controlled, non-inferiority study conducted to evaluate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with gout who were treated with febuxostat tablets. The study enrolled patients who had a history of major CV disease, cerebrovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with micro-and/or macrovascular disease. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. Results showed that febuxostat tablets was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of MACE [Hazard Ratio: 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.89, 1.21]. However, there was a significant increase in CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat tablets (134 [1.5 per 100 patient-years]) compared to patients treated with allopurinol (100 [1.1 per 100 patient-years]) [Hazard Ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.73]. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). Febuxostat tablets were similar to allopurinol for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat tablets should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat tablets [see Indications and Usage (1)] . Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse CV event signs and symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat tablets, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat tablets are initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat tablets, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat tablets and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat tablets. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), febuxostat tablets treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Febuxostat tablets should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on febuxostat tablets. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat tablets can be used with caution. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat tablets should be used with caution in these patients."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the prescribing information: Cardiovascular Death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatic Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions occurring in at least 1% of patients treated with febuxostat tablets, and at least 0.5% greater than placebo, are liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat tablets 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat tablets 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat tablets 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat tablets 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were six to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat tablets treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat tablets with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. (7) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat tablets with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat tablets may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat tablets during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat tablets do not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be used concomitantly with these medications."

(8.7) No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia(including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients); therefore, febuxostat tablets are not recommended for use in these patients. (8.8) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat tablets in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat tablet is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat tablets are not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat tablet, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat tablet is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat tablets resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat tablets on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat tablets in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life ( t1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat tablet has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), or moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two-and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat tablets have not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat Tablets on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat tablets upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat tablets may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat tablets drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat tablet is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat tablets and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Tablets Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat tablets and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-\u00admethylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat tablets. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat tablets and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablet or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat tablets (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%) Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablets or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat tablets. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat tablets are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat tablet (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), or moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two-and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat tablets have not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat Tablets on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat tablets upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat tablets may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat tablets drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat tablet is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat tablets and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Tablets Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat tablets and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-\u00admethylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat tablets. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat tablets and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablet or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat tablets (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%) Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablets or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat tablets. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat tablets are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat tablet (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat tablets were demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat tablet 40 mg daily, febuxostat tablet 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat tablet 80 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00102440), a one year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat tablet 80 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat tablets for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat tablets were also evaluated in a four week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat tablet 40 mg daily, febuxostat tablet 80 mg daily, or febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat tablets for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency [percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL per min] 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u2265 30 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u2265 10 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat tablets 80 mg were superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat tablet 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3 ) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels Less Than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study* Febuxostat Tablets 40 mg daily Febuxostat Tablets 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat Tablets 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat Tablets 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) *Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. In 76% of febuxostat tablets 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat tablets 80 mg than with febuxostat tablets 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat Tablets 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat Tablets 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol * 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat Tablets 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat Tablets 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) *Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat tablets. The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat tablets (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat tablets initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat tablets group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat tablets (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat tablets is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat tablets group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Effects : Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat tablets and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions : Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2,757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1,377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3,098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2,155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1,539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were 6 to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. ( 8.7 ) \u2022 Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): Febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity.

Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Study* Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) * Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol* 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) * Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and Cl cr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3,098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3,092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eClcr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat tablets were similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat tablets should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1) ] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat tablets. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat tablets, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat tablets are initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat tablets have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat tablets and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat tablets. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat tablets treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat tablets if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat tablets in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat tablets can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat tablets should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat tablets with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat tablet is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat tablets with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat tablets and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat tablets during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat tablets do not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. ( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): Febuxostat tablets are not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for febuxostat tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat tablets in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat tablets are not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat tablets, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat tablets are not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat tablets resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat tablets on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat tablets in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat tablets has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat tablets have not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat Tablets on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat tablets upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat tablets and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat tablets caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat tablet is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat tablets and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Tablets Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat tablets and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat tablets. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat tablets and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablets or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablets (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat tablets (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablets or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat tablets. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat tablets are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat tablets (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat tablets resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat tablets on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat tablets in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat tablets has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat tablets have not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function.

Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u2265 8 mg/dL. Study 1 ( NCT00430248 ) randomized patients to: febuxostat tablets 40 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u2265 60 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u2265 30 mL/min and \u2264 59 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 ( NCT00174915 ) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat tablets 80 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u2264 2 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 ( NCT00102440 ), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat tablets 80 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat tablets for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat tablets was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat tablets 40 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 80 mg daily, or febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat tablets for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat tablets use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies.

Febuxostat tablets 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo.

Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u2265 10 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat tablets 80 mg than with febuxostat tablets 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat tablets initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u2265 6mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u2265 60 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u2265 30 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat tablets group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat tablets (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat tablets is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat tablets group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "2 DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after 2 weeks, the recommended dosage is 80 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Patients with severe renal impairment: Limit the dosage to 40 mg once daily. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) Flare prophylaxis is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. ( 2.4 ) Can be administered without regard to food or antacid use. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablets is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of including febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) \u2022Hepatic Effects: Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported.. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and then treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) \u2022Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in allopurinol group (56 of 3,092;). febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [ see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage ( 1 ) ]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat.Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat, have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause.. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in postmarketing patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [ see Patient Counseling Information ( 17) ]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients. 5.5 Risk of Allergic Reactions due to Tartrazine This product contains FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity."

( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-888-943-3210 or 1-855-926-3384 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were 6 to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u22651% of Patients Treated with Febuxostat and at Least 0.5% Greater than in Patients Receiving Placebo in Controlled Studies Adverse Reactions Placebo Febuxostat allopurinol* (N=134) 40 mg daily (N=757) 80 mg daily (N=1279) (N=1277) Liver Function Abnormalities 0.7% 6.6% 4.6% 4.2% Nausea 0.7% 1.1% 1.3% 0.8% Arthralgia 0% 1.1% 0.7% 0.7% Rash 0.7% 0.5% 1.6% 1.6% *Of the patients who received allopurinol, 10 received 100 mg, 145 received 200 mg, and 1122 received 300 mg, based on level of renal impairment. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy was liver function abnormalities in 1.8% of febuxostat 40 mg, 1.2% of febuxostat 80 mg, and in 0.9% of patients treated with allopurinol. In addition to the adverse reactions presented in Table 1, dizziness was reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo.

( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [ see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 - 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 - 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC\u221e. As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Clcr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Clcr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Clcr 10 to 29 mL/min), the Cmax of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Clcr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean Cmax and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in Cmax and 7% in AUC24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in Cmax or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in Cmax or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC\u221e. As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use.

The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Clcr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Clcr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Clcr 10 to 29 mL/min), the Cmax of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Clcr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean Cmax and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [ see Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 ) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in Cmax and 7% in AUC24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in Cmax or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in Cmax or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Clcr) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00102440), a one year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a four week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2 and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit: Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study* Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in proportion (95% CI) Febuxost at 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) *Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol* 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) *Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u2265 60 to <90 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA <6mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr \u226530 to <60 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA <6 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )] . 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )] . Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. ( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): Febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary: Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data: Animal Data : In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary: There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data: Animal Data : Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption: The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution: The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism: Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination: Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations: Geriatric Patients : The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment : In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients: Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups : No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies: Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs : Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline : Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs : In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat : Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies: Azathioprine : Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline : No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine : No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen : No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin : No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide : No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin : No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine : Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption: The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution: The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism: Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination: Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations: Geriatric Patients : The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years).

No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] .

AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group).

The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function.

Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Clcr) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies.

In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) Allopurinol Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr\u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 300 mg daily (N=501) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eClcr) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eClcr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablet is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablet dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablet is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat tablet in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat tablets therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1)] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. (2.4, 5.2) \u2022 Hepatic Effects: Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat tablets and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat tablets if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.3) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected. (5.4) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat tablets were similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat tablets should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat tablets. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat tablets, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat tablets are initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat tablets have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat tablets and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat tablets. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat tablets treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat tablets if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat tablets in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat tablets can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat tablets should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following serious adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the prescribing information: Cardiovascular Death [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] Hepatic Effects [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] Serious Skin Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)] Adverse reactions occurring in \u2265 1% of patients treated with febuxostat tablets are liver function abnormalities, nausea, arthralgia, and rash. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat tablets 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat tablets 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat tablets 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat tablets 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were six to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat tablets treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Occurring in \u2265 1% of Patients Treated with Febuxostat Tablets and at Least 0.5% Greater than in Patients Receiving Placebo in Controlled Studies Adverse Reactions Placebo Febuxostat Tablets allopurinol* (N=134) 40 mg daily (N=757) 80 mg daily (N=1279) N=1277 Liver Function Abnormalities 0.7% 6.6% 4.6% 4.2% Nausea 0.7% 1.1% 1.3% 0.8% Arthralgia 0% 1.1% 0.7% 0.7% Rash 0.7% 0.5% 1.6% 1.6% * Of the patients who received allopurinol, 10 received 100 mg, 145 received 200 mg, and 1122 received 300 mg, based on level of renal impairment. The most common adverse reaction leading to discontinuation from therapy was liver function abnormalities in 1.8% of febuxostat tablets 40 mg, 1.2% of febuxostat tablets 80 mg, and in 0.9% of patients treated with allopurinol. In addition to the adverse reactions presented in Table 1, dizziness was reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat tablets although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than placebo. In the CARES study, liver function abnormalities and diarrhea were reported in more than 1% of patients treated with febuxostat tablets, although not at a rate more than 0.5% greater than allopurinol. Less Common Adverse Reactions In clinical studies the following adverse reactions occurred in less than 1% of patients and in more than one subject treated with doses ranging from 40 mg to 240 mg of febuxostat tablets.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat tablets with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. (7) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat tablets with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat tablets during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat tablets do not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be used concomitantly with these medications."

(8.7) \u2022 Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): febuxostat tablets are not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. (8.8) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat tablets in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat tablet is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat tablets are not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat tablet, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat tablet is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat tablets resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24- hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat tablets on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat tablets in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life ( t1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat tablet has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), or moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two-and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat tablets have not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat Tablets on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat tablets upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat tablets and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat tablets caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat tablet is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat tablets and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Tablets Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat tablets and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat tablets and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-\u00admethylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat tablets. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat tablets and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablet or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat tablets (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%) Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablets or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat tablets. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat tablets are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat tablet (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat tablets resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24- hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat tablets on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat tablets in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life ( t1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat tablet has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), or moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two-and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat tablets have not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat Tablets on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat tablets upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat tablets and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat tablets caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat tablet is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat tablets and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Tablets Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat tablets and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat tablets and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablets (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-\u00admethylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat tablets. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat tablets and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablet or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat tablets (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%) Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat tablets or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat tablets when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat tablets. Administration of febuxostat tablet (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat tablets. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat tablets are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat tablet (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat tablets were demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat tablet 40 mg daily, febuxostat tablet 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat tablet 80 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat tablet 80 mg daily, febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat tablets for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat tablets were also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat tablet 40 mg daily, febuxostat tablet 80 mg daily, or febuxostat tablets 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat tablets for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies.

Febuxostat tablet 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3 ) .

In 76% of febuxostat tablets 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat tablets 80 mg than with febuxostat tablets 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat tablets (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat tablets initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat tablets group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat tablets (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat tablets is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat tablets group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after 2 weeks, the recommended dosage is 80 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Can be administered without regard to food or antacid use. ( 2.1 ) Limit the dosage of febuxostat tablets to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Dose The recommended febuxostat dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablets are 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets are limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.3 Uric Acid Level Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat tablets therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Death: In a CV outcomes study, there was a higher rate of CV death in patients treated with febuxostat compared to allopurinol; in the same study febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. ( 1 , 5.1 ) Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects : Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01101035), gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with gout who were treated with febuxostat. The study enrolled patients who had a history of major CV disease, cerebrovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with micro-and/or macrovascular disease. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. Results showed that febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of MACE [Hazard Ratio: 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.89, 1.21]. However, there was a significant increase in CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 [1.5 per 100 patient-years]) compared to patients treated with allopurinol (100 [1.1 per 100 patient-years]) [Hazard Ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.73]. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse CV event signs and symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01101035), gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. The CV outcomes study in patients with gout (CARES) was a randomized, double-blinded, allopurinol-controlled, non-inferiority study conducted to evaluate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with gout who were treated with febuxostat. The study enrolled patients who had a history of major CV disease, cerebrovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with micro-and/or macrovascular disease. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. Results showed that febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of MACE [Hazard Ratio: 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.89, 1.21]. However, there was a significant increase in CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 [1.5 per 100 patient-years]) compared to patients treated with allopurinol (100 [1.1 per 100 patient-years]) [Hazard Ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.73]. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [ see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [ see Indications and Usage(1)]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat [ see Indications and Usage (1)]. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse CV event signs and symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), febuxostat treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Febuxostat should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on febuxostat. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with caution. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [ see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with caution in these patients."

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years.In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were six to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of Febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy subjects, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

Caution should be exercised in these patients.( 8.7 ) No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients); therefore, febuxostat is not recommended for use in these patients. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1)], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients(\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients(\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of anti-hyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00102440), a one year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which Patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, Patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a four week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which Patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the Patients enrolled in the studies.

Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric A c id Levels le ss than 6 mg /dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo.

Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer Patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.2)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . 2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u00b7 Gout Flares : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months.(2.4, 5.2) \u00b7 Hepatic Effects: Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. (5.3) \u00b7 Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. (5.4) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat tablets were similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2)] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat tablets should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage(1)] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat tablets. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17)] . Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat tablets should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. (7) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4)]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

(8.7) \u00b7 Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): Febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. (8.8) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1)] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 mL/min to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 mL/min to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat tablets, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7)]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies A zathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1\u00ad-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t \u00bd ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food.

Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4 week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656 mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after 2 weeks, the recommended dosage is 80 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Patients with severe renal impairment: Limit the dosage to 40 mg once daily. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) Flare prophylaxis is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat. ( 2.4 ) Can be administered without regard to food or antacid use. ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended febuxostat dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablet is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Concurrent prophylactic treatment with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment The recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. No dose modification is necessary when administering febuxostat in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. No dosage modification is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 2.3 Serum Uric Acid Level Monitoring Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects: Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 )]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat, have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 )]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 - 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] , 16 % were 65 and over, while 4 % were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hours mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hours mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hours mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 hours to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 hour and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1, (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are co administered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the co administration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1, (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u2265 65 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are co administered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the co administration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Two year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in F344 rats and B6C3F1 mice. Increased transitional cell papilloma and carcinoma of the urinary bladder was observed at 24 mg/kg (25 times the MRHD on an AUC basis) and 18.75 mg/kg (12.5 times the MRHD on an AUC basis) in male rats and female mice, respectively. The urinary bladder neoplasms were secondary to calculus formation in the kidney and urinary bladder. Febuxostat showed a positive clastogenic response in a chromosomal aberration assay in a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line with and without metabolic activation in vitro . Febuxostat was negative in the following genotoxicity assays: the in vitro Ames assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral lymphocytes, the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell line assay, the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, and the rat unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male or female rats that received febuxostat at oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 31 and 40 times the MRHD on an AUC basis in males and females respectively). 13.2 Animal Toxicology A 12 months toxicity study in beagle dogs showed deposition of xanthine crystals and calculi in kidneys at 15 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). A similar effect of calculus formation was noted in rats in a 6 months study due to deposition of xanthine crystals at 48 mg/kg (approximately 31 and 40 times the MRHD on an AUC basis in males and females respectively)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u2265 8 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u2265 60 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u2265 30 mL/min and \u2264 59 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u2264 2 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4 week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2 Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2 and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/ min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u2265 30 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u2265 10 mg /dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3 Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit * Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo.

Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u2265 10 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4 Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels Less Than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit * Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Cl cr \u2265 30 mL/min and Cl cr \u2264 59 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Dose The recommended febuxostat dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat Tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary when administering febuxostat in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment . The recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 2.3 Uric Acid Level Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Cardiovascular Death: In a CV outcomes study, there was a higher rate of CV death in patients treated with Febuxostat Tablets compared to allopurinol; in the same study Febuxostat Tablets was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Consider the risks and benefits of Febuxostat Tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on Febuxostat Tablets. ( 1 , 5.1 ) \u2022 Gout Flares : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) \u2022 Hepatic Effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Serious Skin Reactions: Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01101035), gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. The CV outcomes study in patients with gout (CARES) was a randomized, double-blinded, allopurinol-controlled, non-inferiority study conducted to evaluate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with gout who were treated with febuxostat. The study enrolled patients who had a history of major CV disease, cerebrovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with micro-and/or macrovascular disease. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. Results showed that febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of MACE [Hazard Ratio: 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.89, 1.21]. However, there was a significant increase in CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 [1.5 per 100 patient-years]) compared to patients treated with allopurinol (100 [1.1 per 100 patient-years]) [Hazard Ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.73]. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [ see Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [ see Indications and Usage(1)]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat [ see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse CV event signs and symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), febuxostat treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Febuxostat should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on febuxostat. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with caution. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with caution in these patients."

( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

( 8.7 ) \u2022 No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients); therefore, febuxostat is not recommended for use in these patients. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary: Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data: Animal Data : In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary: There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data: Animal Data : Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Clcr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption: The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution: The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism: Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination: Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations: Geriatric Patients : The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment : In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Male and Female Patients: Following multiple oral doses of feboxustat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups : No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies: Effect of Feboxustat on Other Drugs : Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline : Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs : In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat : Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies: Theophylline : No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine : No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen : No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin : No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide : No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin : No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine : Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption: The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution: The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism: Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination: Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations: Geriatric Patients : The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment : In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Male and Female Patients: Following multiple oral doses of feboxustat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups : No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies: Effect of Feboxustat on Other Drugs : Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline : Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs : In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat : Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies: Theophylline : No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine : No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen : No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin : No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide : No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin : No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine : Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Clcr) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00102440), a one year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a four week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian 80% African American 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit: Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit ( Table 3 ). Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Clcr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eClcr) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eClcr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eClcr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after 2 weeks, the recommended dosage is 80 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Can be administered without regard to food or antacid use. ( 2.1 ) Limit the dosage of febuxostat tablets to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Dose The recommended febuxostat dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dosage of febuxostat tablets are 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after two weeks, the recommended febuxostat tablets dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets are limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.3 Uric Acid Level Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat tablets therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat tablets treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2)] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Death: In a CV outcomes study, there was a higher rate of CV death in patients treated with febuxostat compared to allopurinol; in the same study febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. ( 1 , 5.1 ) Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects : Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01101035), gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. The CV outcomes study in patients with gout (CARES) was a randomized, double-blinded, allopurinol-controlled, non-inferiority study conducted to evaluate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with gout who were treated with febuxostat. The study enrolled patients who had a history of major CV disease, cerebrovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with micro-and/or macrovascular disease. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. Results showed that febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of MACE [Hazard Ratio: 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.89, 1.21]. However, there was a significant increase in CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 [1.5 per 100 patient-years]) compared to patients treated with allopurinol (100 [1.1 per 100 patient-years]) [Hazard Ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.73]. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [ see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [ see Indications and Usage(1)]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat [ see Indications and Usage (1)]. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse CV event signs and symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), febuxostat treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Febuxostat should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on febuxostat. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with caution. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [ see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with caution in these patients."

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years.In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were six to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of Febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy subjects, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

Caution should be exercised in these patients.( 8.7 ) No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients); therefore, febuxostat is not recommended for use in these patients. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1)], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients(\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients(\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Drug Interactions ( 7 )] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of anti-hyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00102440), a one year study, randomized patients to: febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which Patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, Patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a four week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which Patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the Patients enrolled in the studies.

Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric A c id Levels le ss than 6 mg /dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo.

In all treatment groups, fewer Patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4.

The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended febuxostat dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL after 2 weeks, the recommended dosage is 80 mg once daily. ( 2.1 ) Can be administered without regard to food or antacid use. ( 2.1 ) Limit the dosage of febuxostat tablet to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment. ( 2.2 , 8.6 ) 2.1 Recommended Dose The recommended febuxostat dosage is 40 mg or 80 mg once daily. The recommended starting dose of febuxostat tablet is 40 mg once daily. For patients who do not achieve a serum uric acid (sUA) less than 6 mg/dL two weeks, the recommended febuxostat dosage is 80 mg once daily. Febuxostat tablets can be taken without regard to food or antacid use [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3) ]. 2.2 Dosage Recommendations in Patients with Renal Impairment and Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary when administering febuxostat tablets in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. The recommended dosage of febuxostat tablet is limited to 40 mg once daily in patients with severe renal impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 2.3 Uric Acid Level Testing for the target serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL may be performed as early as two weeks after initiating febuxostat therapy. 2.4 Recommended Prophylaxis for Gout Flares Gout flares may occur after initiation of febuxostat tablets due to changing serum uric acid levels resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. Flare prophylaxis with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or colchicine is recommended upon initiation of febuxostat tablets. Prophylactic therapy may be beneficial for up to six months [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. If a gout flare occurs during febuxostat treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. The gout flare should be managed concurrently, as appropriate for the individual patient [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Cardiovascular Death: In a CV outcomes study, there was a higher rate of CV death in patients treated with febuxostat compared to allopurinol; in the same study febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. ( 1 , 5.1 ) Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed during initiation of anti-hyperuricemic agents, including febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug [NSAID] or colchicine upon initiation of treatment) may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects: Postmarketing reports of hepatic failure, sometimes fatal. Causality cannot be excluded. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and assess patient for probable cause, then treat cause if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Do not restart febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01101035), gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. The CV outcomes study in patients with gout (CARES) was a randomized, double-blinded, allopurinol-controlled, non-inferiority study conducted to evaluate the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with gout who were treated with febuxostat. The study enrolled patients who had a history of major CV disease, cerebrovascular disease or diabetes mellitus with micro-and/or macrovascular disease. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. Results showed that febuxostat was non-inferior to allopurinol for the primary endpoint of MACE [Hazard Ratio: 1.03, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.89, 1.21]. However, there was a significant increase in CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 [1.5 per 100 patient-years]) compared to patients treated with allopurinol (100 [1.1 per 100 patient-years]) [Hazard Ratio: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.73]. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )].Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage( 1 )]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat [see Indications and Usage ( 1 )]. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Physicians and patients should remain alert for the development of adverse CV event signs and symptoms. Patients should be informed about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.4 ) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects There have been postmarketing reports of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat, although the reports contain insufficient information necessary to establish the probable cause. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient is found to have abnormal liver tests (ALT greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), febuxostat treatment should be interrupted and investigation done to establish the probable cause. Febuxostat should not be restarted in these patients without another explanation for the liver test abnormalities. Patients who have serum ALT greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury and should not be restarted on febuxostat. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with caution. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Postmarketing reports of serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information ( 17 ) ]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with caution in these patients."

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2,757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1,377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years. In the CARES study, a total of 3,098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2,155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1,539 were treated for \u22652 years [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were six to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Caution should be exercised in these patients. ( 8.7 ) No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients); therefore, febuxostat is not recommended for use in these patients. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 to 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 to 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat tablet is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on U ric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24 hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24 hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 ) ]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline: Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-\u00admethylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ].

Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline: Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine and azathioprine) have not been conducted. Inhibition of XO by febuxostat may cause increased plasma concentrations of these drugs leading to toxicity. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Although febuxostat drug interaction studies with azathioprine and mercaptopurine have not been conducted, concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of azathioprine and mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of azathioprine or mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-\u00admethylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1(ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00430248) randomized patients to: Febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00102440), a one year study, randomized patients to: Febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a four week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study * Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2,268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) *Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol * 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7%(1%, 14%) 29%(23%, 35%) * Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and Cl cr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat. The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gout Flares: An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects : Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions: Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1) ]. Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat is initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.4)]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat. Discontinue febuxostat if serious skin reactions are suspected [ see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

In Phase 2 and 3 clinical studies, a total of 2757 patients with hyperuricemia and gout were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily. For febuxostat 40 mg, 559 patients were treated for \u22656 months. For febuxostat 80 mg, 1377 patients were treated for \u22656 months, 674 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 515 patients were treated for \u22652 years.In the CARES study, a total of 3098 patients were treated with febuxostat 40 mg or 80 mg daily; of these, 2155 patients were treated for \u22651 year and 1539 were treated for \u22652 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Most Common Adverse Reactions In three randomized, controlled clinical studies (Studies 1, 2 and 3), which were 6 to 12 months in duration, the following adverse reactions were reported by the treating physician as related to study drug. Table 1 summarizes adverse reactions reported at a rate of at least 1% in febuxostat treatment groups and at least 0.5% greater than placebo.

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ] . 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . Therefore, febuxostat may be used concomitantly with these medications."

( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): febuxostat is not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre-and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre-and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for febuxostat and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat in the treatment of gout) [ see Clinical Studies (14.1)], 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat is limited to 40 mg once daily [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child- Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat is not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations: In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24-hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization: The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs. 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (V ss /F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2%, (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients(\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )] . Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected C max and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ] . Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on Febuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

Febuxostat was negative in the following genotoxicity assays: the in vitro Ames assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral lymphocytes, the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell line assay, the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, and the rat unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male or female rats that received febuxostat atoral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 31 and 40 times the MRHD on an AUC basis in males and females respectively). 13.2 Animal Toxicology A 12-month toxicity study in beagle dogs showed deposition of xanthine crystals and calculi in kidneys at 15 mg/kg (approximately 4 times the MRHD on an AUC basis). A similar effect of calculus formation was noted in rats in a 6-month study due to deposition of xanthine crystals at 48 mg/kg (approximately 31 and 40 times the MRHD on an AUC basis in males and females respectively)."

The urinary bladder neoplasms were secondary to calculus formation in the kidney and urinary bladder. Febuxostat showed a positive clastogenic response in a chromosomal aberration assay in a Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line with and without metabolic activation in vitro. Febuxostat was negative in the following genotoxicity assays: the in vitro Ames assay, in vitro chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral lymphocytes, the L5178Y mouse lymphoma cell line assay, the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, and the rat unscheduled DNA synthesis assay. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in male or female rats that received febuxostat atoral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day (approximately 31 and 40 times the MRHD on an AUC basis in males and females respectively)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of anti-hyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: Febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the Patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian African American 80% 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl Cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3 ). Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Difference in Proportion (95% CI) febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopur inol Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Clcr \u226530 mL/min and Clcr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 300 mg daily (N=501) Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro-or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.

Inform all patients of the higher rate of CV death with febuxostat compared to allopurinol. Alert all patients (those with and without CV disease) for the development of signs and symptoms of CV events and to seek medical care promptly should they occur [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Gout Flares : An increase in gout flares is frequently observed after initiation of febuxostat tablets. If a gout flare occurs during treatment, febuxostat tablets need not be discontinued. Prophylactic therapy (i.e., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug or colchicine) upon initiation of treatment may be beneficial for up to six months. ( 2.4 , 5.2 ) Hepatic Effects : Cases of hepatic failure, some fatal, have been reported. If liver injury is detected, promptly interrupt febuxostat tablets and treat cause, if possible, to resolution or stabilization. Permanently discontinue febuxostat tablets if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. ( 5.3 ) Serious Skin Reactions : Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms and toxic epidermal necrolysis have been reported in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected. ( 5.4 ) 5.1 Cardiovascular Death In a cardiovascular (CV) outcome study, gout patients with established CV disease treated with febuxostat tablets had a higher rate of CV death compared to those treated with allopurinol. Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths, 2.7% in the febuxostat tablets group (83 of 3,098) as compared to 1.8% in the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092). Febuxostat tablets was similar to allopurinol for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), nonfatal stroke and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . Because of the increased risk of CV death, febuxostat tablets should only be used in patients who have an inadequate response to a maximally titrated dose of allopurinol, who are intolerant to allopurinol, or for whom treatment with allopurinol is not advisable [see Indications and Usage (1) ] . Consider the risks and benefits of febuxostat tablets when deciding to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat tablets. Consider use of prophylactic low-dose aspirin therapy in patients with a history of CV disease. Monitor patients for the development of CV events. Inform patients about the symptoms of serious CV events and the steps to take if they occur. 5.2 Gout Flares After initiation of febuxostat tablets, an increase in gout flares is frequently observed. This increase is due to reduction in serum uric acid levels, resulting in mobilization of urate from tissue deposits. In order to prevent gout flares when febuxostat tablets are initiated, concurrent prophylactic treatment with an NSAID or colchicine is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) ]. 5.3 Hepatic Effects Cases of fatal and nonfatal hepatic failure in patients taking febuxostat tablets have been reported. During randomized controlled studies, transaminase elevations greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) were observed (AST: 2%, 2%, and ALT: 3%, 2% in febuxostat tablets and allopurinol-treated patients, respectively). No dose-effect relationship for these transaminase elevations was noted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Obtain a liver test panel (serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alkaline phosphatase, and total bilirubin) as a baseline before initiating febuxostat tablets. Measure liver tests promptly in patients who report symptoms that may indicate liver injury, including fatigue, anorexia, right upper abdominal discomfort, dark urine or jaundice. In this clinical context, if the patient presents abnormal liver tests (ALT or AST greater than three times the upper limit of the reference range), interrupt febuxostat tablets treatment while investigating the probable cause. Permanently discontinue febuxostat tablets if liver injury is confirmed, and no alternate etiology can be found. Permanently discontinue febuxostat tablets in patients who have serum ALT or AST greater than three times the reference range with serum total bilirubin greater than two times the reference range without alternative etiologies because they are at risk for severe drug-induced liver injury. For patients with lesser elevations of serum ALT or bilirubin and with an alternate probable cause, treatment with febuxostat tablets can be used with close monitoring. 5.4 Serious Skin Reactions Serious skin and hypersensitivity reactions, including Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have been reported postmarketing in patients taking febuxostat tablets. Discontinue febuxostat tablets if serious skin reactions are suspected [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Many of these patients had reported previous similar skin reactions to allopurinol. Febuxostat tablets should be used with close monitoring in these patients."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Concomitant administration of febuxostat tablets with XO substrate drugs, azathioprine or mercaptopurine could increase plasma concentrations of these drugs resulting in severe toxicity. ( 7 ) 7.1 Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. Based on a drug interaction study in healthy patients, febuxostat altered the metabolism of theophylline (a substrate of XO) in humans [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat tablets with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat tablets and azathioprine, also metabolized by XO, showed an increase in exposure of 6-mercaptopurine which may lead to toxicity [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat tablets are contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) ]. 7.2 Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Drugs Drug interaction studies of febuxostat tablets with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been conducted. No data are available regarding the safety of febuxostat tablets during cytotoxic chemotherapy. 7.3 In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Based on drug interaction studies in healthy patients, febuxostat tablets does not have clinically significant interactions with colchicine, naproxen, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, warfarin or desipramine [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be used concomitantly with these medications."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Patients with severe hepatic impairment: No studies have been conducted in this patient population. Caution should be exercised in these patients. ( 8.7 ) Patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including patients being treated for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome or malignant disease, or in organ transplant recipients): febuxostat tablets are not recommended for use as no studies have been conducted in this patient population. ( 8.8 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Limited available data with febuxostat tablets use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. No adverse developmental effects were observed in embryo-fetal development studies with oral administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses that produced maternal exposures up to 40 and 51 times, respectively, the exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD). No adverse developmental effects were observed in a pre- and postnatal development study with administration of febuxostat to pregnant rats from organogenesis through lactation at an exposure approximately 11 times the MRHD (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the US general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 7 \u2013 17, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development or survival at exposures up to approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation Days 6 \u2013 18, febuxostat was not teratogenic and did not affect fetal development at exposures up to approximately 51 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at maternal oral doses up to 48 mg/kg/day). In a pre- and postnatal development study in pregnant female rats dosed orally from gestation Day 7 through lactation Day 20, febuxostat had no effects on delivery or growth and development of offspring at a dose approximately 11 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 12 mg/kg/day). However, increased neonatal mortality and a reduction in neonatal body weight gain were observed in the presence of maternal toxicity at a dose approximately 40 times the MRHD (on an AUC basis at a maternal oral dose of 48 mg/kg/day). Febuxostat crossed the placental barrier following oral administration to pregnant rats and was detected in fetal tissues. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of febuxostat in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Febuxostat is present in rat milk. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for febuxostat tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from febuxostat tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Animal Data Orally administered febuxostat was detected in the milk of lactating rats at up to approximately 7 times the plasma concentration. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of febuxostat tablets in pediatric patients have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is necessary in elderly patients. Of the total number of patients in Studies 1, 2, and 3 (clinical studies of febuxostat tablets in the treatment of gout) [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] , 16% were 65 and over, while 4% were 75 and over. Comparing patients in different age groups, no clinically significant differences in safety or effectiveness were observed but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The C max and AUC 24 of febuxostat following multiple oral doses of febuxostat tablets in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.6 Renal Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (Cl cr 30 to 89 mL/min). For patients with severe renal impairment (Cl cr 15 to 29 mL/min), the recommended dosage of febuxostat tablets is limited to 40 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3 ) ]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A or B). No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); therefore, caution should be exercised in these patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 8.8 Secondary Hyperuricemia No studies have been conducted in patients with secondary hyperuricemia (including organ transplant recipients); febuxostat tablets are not recommended for use in patients whom the rate of urate formation is greatly increased (e.g., malignant disease and its treatment, Lesch-Nyhan syndrome). The concentration of xanthine in urine could, in rare cases, rise sufficiently to allow deposition in the urinary tract."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Febuxostat, a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, achieves its therapeutic effect by decreasing serum uric acid. Febuxostat is not expected to inhibit other enzymes involved in purine and pyrimidine synthesis and metabolism at therapeutic concentrations. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Effect on Uric Acid and Xanthine Concentrations In healthy patients, febuxostat resulted in a dose dependent decrease in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations and an increase in 24- hour mean serum xanthine concentrations. In addition, there was a decrease in the total daily urinary uric acid excretion. Also, there was an increase in total daily urinary xanthine excretion. Percent reduction in 24-hour mean serum uric acid concentrations was between 40% and 55% at the exposure levels of 40 mg and 80 mg daily doses. Effect on Cardiac Repolarization The effect of febuxostat on cardiac repolarization as assessed by the QTc interval was evaluated in normal healthy patients and in patients with gout. Febuxostat in doses up to 300 mg daily (3.75 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), at steady-state, did not demonstrate an effect on the QTc interval. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics In healthy patients, maximum plasma concentrations (C max ) and AUC of febuxostat increased in a dose proportional manner following single and multiple doses of 10 mg (0.25 times the lowest recommended dosage) to 120 mg (1.5 times the maximum recommended dosage). There is no accumulation when therapeutic doses are administered every 24 hours. Febuxostat has an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of approximately 5 to 8 hours. Febuxostat pharmacokinetic parameters for patients with hyperuricemia and gout estimated by population pharmacokinetic analyses were similar to those estimated in healthy patients. Absorption The absorption of radiolabeled febuxostat following oral dose administration was estimated to be at least 49% (based on total radioactivity recovered in urine). Maximum plasma concentrations of febuxostat occurred between 1 and 1.5 hours postdose. After multiple oral 40 mg and 80 mg once daily doses, C max is approximately 1.6 \u00b1 0.6 mcg/mL (N=30), and 2.6 \u00b1 1.7 mcg/mL (N=227), respectively. Absolute bioavailability of the febuxostat tablet has not been studied. Following multiple 80 mg once daily doses with a high fat meal, there was a 49% decrease in C max and an 18% decrease in AUC, respectively. However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the Cmax and AUC24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on F ebuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1\u00ad-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

However, no clinically significant change in the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was observed (58% fed vs 51% fasting). Thus, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to food. Concomitant ingestion of an antacid containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide with an 80 mg single dose of febuxostat has been shown to delay absorption of febuxostat (approximately one hour) and to cause a 31% decrease in C max and a 15% decrease in AUC \u221e . As AUC rather than C max was related to drug effect, change observed in AUC was not considered clinically significant. Therefore, febuxostat tablets may be taken without regard to antacid use. Distribution The mean apparent steady state volume of distribution (Vss/F) of febuxostat was approximately 50 L (CV ~40%). The plasma protein binding of febuxostat is approximately 99.2% (primarily to albumin), and is constant over the concentration range achieved with 40 mg and 80 mg doses. Metabolism Febuxostat is extensively metabolized by both conjugation via uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes including UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7 and oxidation via cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes including CYP1A2, 2C8 and 2C9 and non-P450 enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform in the metabolism of febuxostat is not clear. The oxidation of the isobutyl side chain leads to the formation of four pharmacologically active hydroxy metabolites, all of which occur in plasma of humans at a much lower extent than febuxostat. In urine and feces, acyl glucuronide metabolites of febuxostat (~35% of the dose), and oxidative metabolites, 67M-1 (~10% of the dose), 67M-2 (~11% of the dose), and 67M-4, a secondary metabolite from 67M-1 (~14% of the dose), appeared to be the major metabolites of febuxostat in vivo . Elimination Febuxostat is eliminated by both hepatic and renal pathways. Following an 80 mg oral dose of 14 C-labeled febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was recovered in the urine as unchanged febuxostat (3%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (30%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (13%), and other unknown metabolites (3%). In addition to the urinary excretion, approximately 45% of the dose was recovered in the feces as the unchanged febuxostat (12%), the acyl glucuronide of the drug (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugates (25%), and other unknown metabolites (7%). The apparent mean terminal elimination half-life (t 1/2 ) of febuxostat was approximately 5 to 8 hours. Specific Populations Geriatric Patients The C max and AUC of febuxostat and its metabolites following multiple oral doses of febuxostat in geriatric patients (\u226565 years) were similar to those in younger patients (18 to 40 years). In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was similar between elderly and younger patients. No dose adjustment is necessary in geriatric patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Patients with Renal Impairment In a dedicated phase I pharmacokinetics study, following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in healthy patients with mild (Cl cr 50 to 80 mL/min), moderate (Cl cr 30 to 49 mL/min) or severe renal impairment (Cl cr 10 to 29 mL/min), the C max of febuxostat did not change relative to patients with normal renal function (Cl cr greater than 80 mL/min). AUC and half-life of febuxostat increased in patients with renal impairment in comparison to patients with normal renal function, but values were similar among three renal impairment groups. Mean febuxostat AUC values were up to 1.8 times higher in patients with renal impairment compared to those with normal renal function. Mean C max and AUC values for three active metabolites increased up to two and four-fold, respectively. However, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration for patients with renal impairment was comparable to those with normal renal function (58% in normal renal function group and 55% in the severe renal function group). Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, following multiple 40 mg or 80 mg doses of febuxostat, the mean oral clearance (CL/F) values of febuxostat in patients with gout and mild (n=334), moderate (n=232) or severe (n=34) renal impairment were decreased by 14%, 34%, and 48%, respectively, compared to patients with normal (n=89) renal function. The corresponding median AUC values of febuxostat at steady-state in patients with renal impairment were increased by 18%, 49%, and 96% after 40 mg dose, and 7%, 45% and 98% after 80 mg dose, respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. Febuxostat has not been studied in end stage renal impairment patients who are on dialysis. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Following multiple 80 mg doses of febuxostat in patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment, an average of 20% to 30% increase was observed for both C max and AUC 24 (total and unbound) in hepatic impairment groups compared to patients with normal hepatic function. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentration was comparable between different hepatic groups (62% in healthy group, 49% in mild hepatic impairment group, and 48% in moderate hepatic impairment group). No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. No studies have been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C); caution should be exercised in those patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Male and Female Patients Following multiple oral doses of febuxostat, the Cmax and AUC24 of febuxostat were 30% and 14% higher in females than in males, respectively. However, weight-corrected Cmax and AUC were similar between the genders. In addition, the percent decrease in serum uric acid concentrations was similar between genders. No dose adjustment is necessary based on gender. Racial Groups No specific pharmacokinetic study was conducted to investigate the effects of race. Drug Interaction Studies Effect of Febuxostat on Other Drugs Xanthine Oxidase Substrate Drugs-Azathioprine, Mercaptopurine, and Theophylline Febuxostat is an XO inhibitor. A drug-drug interaction study evaluating the effect of febuxostat upon the pharmacokinetics of theophylline (an XO substrate) in healthy patients showed that coadministration of febuxostat with theophylline resulted in an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1-methylxanthine, one of the major metabolites of theophylline, excreted in the urine. Since the long-term safety of exposure to 1-methylxanthine in humans is unknown, use with caution when coadministering febuxostat with theophylline. A drug interaction study of febuxostat and azathioprine has been conducted [see Drug Interactions (7)] . Inhibition of XO by febuxostat caused increased plasma concentrations of 6-mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine, which may lead to toxicity. Drug interaction studies of febuxostat with other drugs that are metabolized by XO (e.g., mercaptopurine) have not been conducted. Febuxostat is contraindicated in patients being treated with azathioprine or mercaptopurine [see Contraindications (4) and Drug Interactions (7) ]. Azathioprine and mercaptopurine undergo metabolism via three major metabolic pathways, one of which is mediated by XO. Concomitant administration of allopurinol [a xanthine oxidase inhibitor] with azathioprine or mercaptopurine has been reported to substantially increase plasma concentrations of these drugs. Because febuxostat is a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, it could inhibit the XO-mediated metabolism of mercaptopurine leading to increased plasma concentrations of mercaptopurine that could result in severe toxicity. P450 Substrate Drugs In vitro studies have shown that febuxostat does not inhibit P450 enzymes CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, or 3A4 and it also does not induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 at clinically relevant concentrations. As such, pharmacokinetic interactions between febuxostat and drugs metabolized by these CYP enzymes are unlikely. Effect of Other Drugs on F ebuxostat Febuxostat is metabolized by conjugation and oxidation via multiple metabolizing enzymes. The relative contribution of each enzyme isoform is not clear. Drug interactions between febuxostat and a drug that inhibits or induces one particular enzyme isoform is in general not expected. In Vivo Drug Interaction Studies Azathioprine Concomitant use of febuxostat and azathioprine is contraindicated. Coadministration with febuxostat (40 mg or 120 mg QD) reduced the apparent clearance of mercaptopurine, a XO substrate, by 83.2% to 83.8% following a single oral dose of azathioprine, a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine. No significant differences were observed in the extent of inhibition of 6-mercaptopurine metabolism by febuxostat 40 mg and 120 mg. Theophylline No dose adjustment is necessary for theophylline when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with theophylline resulted in an increase of 6% in C max and 6.5% in AUC of theophylline. These changes were not considered statistically significant. However, the study also showed an approximately 400-fold increase in the amount of 1\u00ad-methylxanthine (one of the major theophylline metabolites) excreted in urine as a result of XO inhibition by febuxostat. The safety of long-term exposure to 1-methylxanthine has not been evaluated. This should be taken into consideration when deciding to coadminister febuxostat and theophylline. Colchicine No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or colchicine when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (40 mg once daily) with colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) resulted in an increase of 12% in C max and 7% in AUC 24 of febuxostat. In addition, administration of colchicine (0.6 mg twice daily) with febuxostat (120 mg daily) resulted in a less than 11% change in C max or AUC of colchicine for both AM and PM doses. These changes were not considered clinically significant. Naproxen No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat or naproxen when the two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with naproxen (500 mg twice daily) resulted in a 28% increase in C max and a 40% increase in AUC of febuxostat. The increases were not considered clinically significant. In addition, there were no significant changes in the C max or AUC of naproxen (less than 2%). Indomethacin No dose adjustment is necessary for either febuxostat or indomethacin when these two drugs are coadministered. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with indomethacin (50 mg twice daily) did not result in any significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat or indomethacin (less than 7%). Hydrochlorothiazide No dose adjustment is necessary for febuxostat when coadministered with hydrochlorothiazide. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg) with hydrochlorothiazide (50 mg) did not result in any clinically significant changes in C max or AUC of febuxostat (less than 4%), and serum uric acid concentrations were not substantially affected. Warfarin No dose adjustment is necessary for warfarin when coadministered with febuxostat. Administration of febuxostat (80 mg once daily) with warfarin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of warfarin in healthy patients. INR and Factor VII activity were also not affected by the coadministration of febuxostat. Desipramine Coadministration of drugs that are CYP2D6 substrates (such as desipramine) with febuxostat are not expected to require dose adjustment. Febuxostat was shown to be a weak inhibitor of CYP2D6 in vitro and in vivo . Administration of febuxostat (120 mg once daily) with desipramine (25 mg) resulted in an increase in C max (16%) and AUC (22%) of desipramine, which was associated with a 17% decrease in the 2-hydroxydesipramine to desipramine metabolic ratio (based on AUC)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES A serum uric acid level of less than 6 mg/dL is the goal of antihyperuricemic therapy and has been established as appropriate for the treatment of gout. 14.1 Management of Hyperuricemia in Gout The efficacy of febuxostat was demonstrated in three randomized, double-blind, controlled trials in patients with hyperuricemia and gout. Hyperuricemia was defined as a baseline serum uric acid level \u22658 mg/dL. Study 1 (NCT00430248) randomized patients to: Febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with estimated creatinine clearance (Cl cr ) \u226560 mL/min or 200 mg daily for patients with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and \u226459 mL/min). The duration of Study 1 was six months. Study 2 (NCT00174915) randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, febuxostat 240 mg daily or allopurinol (300 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine \u22641.5 mg/dL or 100 mg daily for patients with a baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL and \u22642 mg/dL). The duration of Study 2 was six months. Study 3 (NCT00102440), a year study, randomized patients to: Febuxostat 80 mg daily, febuxostat 120 mg daily, or allopurinol 300 mg daily. Patients who completed Study 2 and Study 3 were eligible to enroll in a Phase 3 long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for over three years. In all three studies, patients received naproxen 250 mg twice daily or colchicine 0.6 mg once or twice daily for gout flare prophylaxis. In Study 1 the duration of prophylaxis was six months; in Study 2 and Study 3 the duration of prophylaxis was eight weeks. The efficacy of febuxostat was also evaluated in a 4-week dose ranging study which randomized patients to: placebo, febuxostat 40 mg daily, febuxostat 80 mg daily, or febuxostat 120 mg daily. Patients who completed this study were eligible to enroll in a long-term extension study in which patients received treatment with febuxostat for up to five years. Patients in these studies were representative of the patient population for which febuxostat use is intended. Table 2 summarizes the demographics and baseline characteristics for the patients enrolled in the studies. Table 2: Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics in Study 1, Study 2, and Study 3 Male 95% Race: Caucasian 80% African American 10% Ethnicity: Hispanic or Latino 7% Alcohol User 67% Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency (percent with estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min) 59% History of Hypertension 49% History of Hyperlipidemia 38% BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 63% Mean BMI 33 kg/m 2 Baseline sUA \u226510 mg/dL 36% Mean baseline sUA 9.7 mg/dL Experienced a gout flare in previous year 85% Serum Uric Acid Level less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Febuxostat 80 mg was superior to allopurinol in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit. Febuxostat 40 mg daily, although not superior to allopurinol, was effective in lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit (Table 3) . Table 3: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL at Final Visit Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Study Randomization was balanced between treatment groups, except in Study 2 in which twice as many patients were randomized to each of the active treatment groups compared to placebo. Febuxostat 40 mg daily Febuxostat 80 mg daily allopurinol Placebo Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol Study 1 (6 months) (N=2268) 45% 67% 42% 3% (-2%, 8%) 25% (20%, 30%) Study 2 (6 months) (N=643) 72% 39% 1% 33% (26%, 42%) Study 3 (12 months) (N=491) 74% 36% 38% (30%, 46%) In 76% of febuxostat 80 mg patients, reduction in serum uric acid levels to less than 6 mg/dL was noted by the Week 2 visit. Average serum uric acid levels were maintained at 6 mg/dL or below throughout treatment in 83% of these patients. In all treatment groups, fewer patients with higher baseline serum urate levels (\u226510 mg/dL) and/or tophi achieved the goal of lowering serum uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL at the final visit; however, a higher proportion achieved a serum uric acid less than 6 mg/dL with febuxostat 80 mg than with febuxostat 40 mg or allopurinol. Study 1 evaluated efficacy in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment (i.e., baseline estimated Cl cr less than 90 mL/min). The results in this subgroup of patients are shown in Table 4. Table 4: Proportion of Patients with Serum Uric Acid Levels less than 6 mg/dL in Patients with Mild or Moderate Renal Impairment at Final Visit Difference in Proportion (95% CI) Febuxostat 40 mg daily (N=479) Febuxostat 80 mg daily (N=503) allopurinol Allopurinol patients (n=145) with estimated Cl cr \u226530 mL/min and Cl cr \u226459 mL/min were dosed at 200 mg daily. 300 mg daily (N=501) Febuxostat 40 mg vs allopurinol Febuxostat 80 mg vs allopurinol 50% 72% 42% 7% (1%, 14%) 29% (23%, 35%) 14.2 Cardiovascular Safety Study A randomized, double-blind, allopurinol-controlled CV outcomes study (CARES) was conducted to evaluate the CV risk of febuxostat (NCT01101035). The study compared the risk of MACE between patients treated with febuxostat (N=3098) and allopurinol-treated patients (N=3092). The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of a MACE defined as the composite of CV death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, or unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization. The study was designed to exclude a prespecified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. An independent committee conducted a blinded evaluation of serious CV adverse events according to predefined criteria (adjudication) for determination of MACE. The study was event driven and patients were followed until a sufficient number of primary outcome events accrued. The median on-study follow-up time was 2.6 years. Patients randomized to febuxostat initially received 40 mg once daily which was increased to 80 mg once daily, if their sUA was \u22656mg/dL at Week 2. For patients randomized to allopurinol, those who had normal renal function or mild renal impairment (estimated creatinine clearance (eCl cr ) \u226560 to \u02c290 mL/minute) initially received 300 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either sUA \u02c26mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 600 mg once daily was achieved; those who had moderate renal impairment (eCl cr \u226530 to \u02c260 mL/minute) initially received 200 mg once daily with 100 mg/day dose increments monthly until either a sUA \u02c26 mg/dL or an allopurinol dosage of 400 mg once daily was achieved. The mean age of the population was 65 years (range: 44 to 93 years). Most patients were male (84%) and Caucasian (69%). Patients had a diagnosis of gout for approximately 12 years, a mean baseline sUA of 8.7 mg/dL, and 90% had experienced at least one gout flare in the past year. CV history included MI (39%), hospitalization for unstable angina (28%), cardiac revascularization (37%), and stroke (14%). The most prevalent comorbid conditions were hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (87%), diabetes mellitus (55%), diabetes mellitus with micro- or macrovascular disease (39%), and renal impairment [92% with an eCl cr 30 to 89 mL/minute]. The use of CV disease medication was balanced across treatment groups. Baseline CV disease medications included: ACE inhibitors or ARBs (70%), lipid modifying agents (74%), aspirin (62%), beta-blockers (59%), calcium channel blockers (26%), and nonaspirin antiplatelet medications (31%). Table 5 shows the study results for the primary MACE composite endpoint and its individual components. For the composite primary endpoint, the febuxostat group was non-inferior compared with the allopurinol group. The rates of nonfatal MI, stroke, and unstable angina with urgent coronary revascularization were similar. There was a higher rate of CV deaths in patients treated with febuxostat (134 CV deaths; 1.5 per 100 PY) than in allopurinol-treated patients (100 CV deaths; 1.1 per 100 PY). Sudden cardiac death was the most common cause of adjudicated CV deaths in the febuxostat group (83 of 3,098; 2.7%) as compared to the allopurinol group (56 of 3,092; 1.8%). The biological plausibility of CV death associated with febuxostat is unclear. All-cause mortality was higher in the febuxostat group (243 deaths [7.8%]; 2.6 per 100 PY) than the allopurinol group (199 deaths [6.4%]; 2.2 per 100 PY) [Hazard Ratio: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.47], due to a higher rate of CV deaths.
