      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin (JANUVIA) 100 mg QD Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation. JANUVIA 100 mg Glipizide A1C (%) N = 576 N = 559 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline A1C value. ) -0.5 -0.6 FPG (mg/dL) N = 583 N = 568 Baseline (mean) 166 164 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -8 -8 Figure 2: Mean Change from Baseline for A1C (%) Over 52 Weeks in a Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Per Protocol Population) The per protocol population (mean baseline A1C of 7.5%) included patients without major protocol violations who had observations at baseline and at Week 52. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin (JANUVIA) 100 mg QD Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min.

The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation. JANUVIA 100 mg Glipizide A1C (%) N = 576 N = 559 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline A1C value. ) -0.5 -0.6 FPG (mg/dL) N = 583 N = 568 Baseline (mean) 166 164 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -8 -8 Figure 2: Mean Change from Baseline for A1C (%) Over 52 Weeks in a Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Per Protocol Population) The per protocol population (mean baseline A1C of 7.5%) included patients without major protocol violations who had observations at baseline and at Week 52. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin (JANUVIA) 100 mg QD Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min.

The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation. JANUVIA 100 mg Glipizide A1C (%) N = 576 N = 559 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline A1C value. ) -0.5 -0.6 FPG (mg/dL) N = 583 N = 568 Baseline (mean) 166 164 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -8 -8 Figure 2: Mean Change from Baseline for A1C (%) Over 52 Weeks in a Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Per Protocol Population) The per protocol population (mean baseline A1C of 7.5%) included patients without major protocol violations who had observations at baseline and at Week 52. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) \u2022 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin (JANUVIA) 100 mg QD Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups. Table 7: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation. JANUVIA 100 mg Glipizide A1C (%) N = 576 N = 559 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline A1C value. ) -0.5 -0.6 FPG (mg/dL) N = 583 N = 568 Baseline (mean) 166 164 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -8 -8 Figure 2: Mean Change from Baseline for A1C (%) Over 52 Weeks in a Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Per Protocol Population) The per protocol population (mean baseline A1C of 7.5%) included patients without major protocol violations who had observations at baseline and at Week 52. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to metformin rescue therapy. JANUVIA 100 mg + Pioglitazone Placebo + Pioglitazone A1C (%) N = 163 N = 174 Baseline (mean) 8.1 8.0 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline value. ) -0.9 -0.2 Difference from placebo + pioglitazone (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -0.7 p<0.001 compared to placebo + pioglitazone.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 13: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-On Combination Therapy with Glimepiride, with or without Metformin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

If you take JANUVIA with another medicine that can cause low blood sugar, such as a sulfonylurea or insulin, your risk of getting low blood sugar is higher. The dose of your sulfonylurea medicine or insulin may need to be lowered while you use JANUVIA. Signs and symptoms of low blood sugar may include: o headache o drowsiness o irritability o hunger o dizziness o confusion o sweating o feeling jittery o weakness o fast heart beat \u2022 Serious allergic reactions. If you have any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, stop taking JANUVIA and call your doctor right away or get emergency medical help. See \" Who should not take JANUVIA? \". Your doctor may give you a medicine for your allergic reaction and prescribe a different medicine for your diabetes. \u2022 Joint pain. Some people who take medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors like JANUVIA, may develop joint pain that can be severe. Call your doctor if you have severe joint pain. \u2022 Skin reaction. Some people who take medicines called DPP-4 inhibitors like JANUVIA may develop a skin reaction called bullous pemphigoid that can require treatment in a hospital. Tell your doctor right away if you develop blisters or the breakdown of the outer layer of your skin (erosion). Your doctor may tell you to stop taking JANUVIA. The most common side effects of JANUVIA include upper respiratory infection, stuffy or runny nose and sore throat, and headache. JANUVIA may have other side effects, including stomach upset and diarrhea, swelling of the hands or legs, when JANUVIA is used with metformin and rosiglitazone (Avandia). Rosiglitazone is another type of diabetes medicine. Tell your doctor if you have any side effect that bothers you or does not go away. These are not all the possible side effects of JANUVIA.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin.

Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation. JANUVIA 100 mg Glipizide A1C (%) N = 576 N = 559 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline A1C value. ) -0.5 -0.6 FPG (mg/dL) N = 583 N = 568 Baseline (mean) 166 164 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -8 -8 Figure 2: Mean Change from Baseline for A1C (%) Over 52 Weeks in a Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Per Protocol Population) The per protocol population (mean baseline A1C of 7.5%) included patients without major protocol violations who had observations at baseline and at Week 52. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin (JANUVIA) 100 mg QD Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min.

The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation. JANUVIA 100 mg Glipizide A1C (%) N = 576 N = 559 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline A1C value. ) -0.5 -0.6 FPG (mg/dL) N = 583 N = 568 Baseline (mean) 166 164 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -8 -8 Figure 2: Mean Change from Baseline for A1C (%) Over 52 Weeks in a Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Per Protocol Population) The per protocol population (mean baseline A1C of 7.5%) included patients without major protocol violations who had observations at baseline and at Week 52. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

      "WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ].

The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide 100 mg sitagliptin and the previously prescribed dose of metformin. For patients taking metformin HCl immediate-release 850 mg twice daily or 1000 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET XR is two 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl extended-release tablets taken together once daily. Maintain the same total daily dose of sitagliptin and metformin when changing between JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release) and JANUMET XR. Do not split, crush or chew JANUMET XR tablets. 2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of JANUMET XR and periodically thereafter. JANUMET XR is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Discontinue JANUMET XR if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Initiation of JANUMET XR in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is not recommended. In patients taking JANUMET XR whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy and limit dose of the sitagliptin component to 50 mg once daily. 2.3 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue JANUMET XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure; restart JANUMET XR if renal function is stable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] ."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis: See boxed warning . ( 5.1 ) Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis in patients treated with sitagliptin. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUMET XR. ( 5.2 ) Heart Failure: Has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUMET XR in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiating JANUMET XR and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function. ( 5.4 ) Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.5 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUMET XR, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.7 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.8 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUMET XR. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of JANUMET XR. In JANUMET XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis, and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue JANUMET XR and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] : Before initiating JANUMET XR, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). JANUMET XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Discontinue JANUMET XR if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) ] . Initiation of JANUMET XR is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . In patients taking JANUMET XR whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking JANUMET XR. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of JANUMET XR with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop JANUMET XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart JANUMET XR if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. JANUMET XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue JANUMET XR. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET XR. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of JANUMET XR in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking sitagliptin with or without metformin. After initiation of JANUMET XR, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUMET XR should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUMET XR. 5.3 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUMET XR prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUMET XR. 5.4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function in patients taking sitagliptin with or without metformin, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiation of therapy with JANUMET XR and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, particularly in elderly patients, renal function should be assessed more frequently and JANUMET XR discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. JANUMET XR is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.5 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on JANUMET XR and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues JANUMET XR may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JANUMET XR [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, one of the components of JANUMET XR. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUMET XR, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUMET XR. 5.8 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.9 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUMET XR. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUMET XR should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.",
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 presents clinically significant drug interactions with JANUMET XR: Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with JANUMET XR Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with JANUMET XR may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Intervention: Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. Examples: Topiramate, zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide. Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT 2 ] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with JANUMET XR. Examples: Ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine. Alcohol Clinical Impact: Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Intervention: Warn patients against alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET XR. Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Clinical Impact: Coadministration of JANUMET XR with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Intervention: Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin. Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. Intervention: When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving JANUMET XR, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving JANUMET XR, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia. Examples: Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring. ( 7 ) Drugs that reduce metformin clearance (such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) may increase the accumulation of metformin. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. ( 7 ) Alcohol can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake. ( 7 )"

Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin Immediate-Release and Rosiglitazone In a placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin immediate-release and rosiglitazone (sitagliptin, N=181; placebo, N=97), the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality through Week 18 in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 5.5%; placebo, 5.2%) and nasopharyngitis (6.1%, 4.1%). Through Week 54, the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin Immediate-Release and Insulin In a 24-week placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin immediate-release and insulin (sitagliptin, N=229; placebo, N=233), the only adverse reaction reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo was hypoglycemia ( Table 3 ). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=5), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required although most (77%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When the combination of sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than that observed with placebo and metformin immediate-release coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin ( Table 3 ). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required: Intent-to-treat population. (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin Immediate-Release Coadministered with Glimepiride or Insulin Add-On to Glimepiride + Metformin Immediate-Release (24 weeks) Sitagliptin 100 mg + Metformin Immediate-Release + Glimepiride Placebo + Metformin Immediate-Release + Glimepiride N = 116 N = 113 Overall (%) 19 (16.4) 1 (0.9) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.82 0.02 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin + Metformin Immediate-Release (24 weeks) Sitagliptin 100 mg + Metformin Immediate-Release + Insulin Placebo + Metformin Immediate-Release + Insulin N = 229 N = 233 Overall (%) 35 (15.3) 19 (8.2) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 0.98 0.61 Severe (%) 1 (0.4) 1 (0.4) The overall incidence of reported adverse reactions of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given sitagliptin alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin immediate-release alone, and 1.6% in patients given sitagliptin in combination with metformin immediate-release. In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin immediate-release alone, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.3% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 2.1% in patients given add-on placebo. In the study of sitagliptin and add-on combination therapy with metformin immediate-release and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In an additional 30-week placebo-controlled study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms With the combination of sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release, no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in electrocardiogram parameters (including the QTc interval) were observed. Pancreatitis In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Sitagliptin The most common adverse experience in sitagliptin monotherapy reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo was nasopharyngitis. Metformin Extended-Release In a 24-week clinical trial in which extended-release metformin or placebo was added to glyburide therapy, the most common (>5% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions in the combined treatment group were hypoglycemia (13.7% vs. 4.9%), diarrhea (12.5% vs. 5.6%), and nausea (6.7% vs. 4.2%). Laboratory Tests Sitagliptin The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%). In most but not all studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs. placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to a small increase in neutrophils. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant. Metformin In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sitagliptin with metformin, sitagliptin, or metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome ; upper respiratory tract infection; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ]; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis) and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia; bullous pemphigoid; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury; rhabdomyolysis."

      "Laboratory Tests Sitagliptin The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%). In most but not all studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs. placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to a small increase in neutrophils. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant. Metformin In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Use: Assess renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUMET XR in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data ] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 6-times, respectively, a 2000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from post-marketing studies do not report a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups. Animal Data Sitagliptin and Metformin No animal reproduction studies were conducted with the coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin. Sitagliptin In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. Metformin Metformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUMET XR in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data ] . There are no reports of adverse effects on breastfed infants exposed to metformin. There is no information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUMET XR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUMET XR or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. Metformin Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUMET XR have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use JANUMET XR In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. [See Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment JANUMET XR The dose of the sitagliptin component should be limited to 50 mg once daily if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET XR is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Metformin Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. JANUMET XR is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]"

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose with JANUMET XR, contact the Poison Control Center. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as indicated by the patient's clinical status. Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis. Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET XR JANUMET XR tablets combine two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin extended-release, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which exerts its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is a biguanide that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics JANUMET XR After administration of two JANUMET XR 50 mg/1000 mg tablets once daily with the evening meal for 7 days in healthy adult subjects, steady-state for sitagliptin and metformin is reached by Day 4 and 5, respectively. Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption JANUMET XR After administration of JANUMET XR tablets once daily, the median T max value for sitagliptin and metformin at steady state is approximately 3 and 8 hours postdose, respectively. The median T max value for sitagliptin and metformin after administration of a single tablet of JANUMET is 3 and 3.5 hours postdose, respectively. Effect of Food After administration of JANUMET XR tablets with a high-fat breakfast, the AUC for sitagliptin was not altered. The mean C max was decreased by 17%, although the median T max was unchanged relative to the fasted state. After administration of JANUMET XR with a high-fat breakfast, the AUC for metformin increased 62%, the C max for metformin decreased by 9%, and the median T max for metformin occurred 2 hours later relative to the fasted state. Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET XR Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET XR in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET XR Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET XR in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET XR Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET XR have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET XR (sitagliptin and metformin extended-release). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) ( Table 5 ), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET XR JANUMET XR tablets combine two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin extended-release, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which exerts its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is a biguanide that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics JANUMET XR After administration of two JANUMET XR 50 mg/1000 mg tablets once daily with the evening meal for 7 days in healthy adult subjects, steady-state for sitagliptin and metformin is reached by Day 4 and 5, respectively. Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption JANUMET XR After administration of JANUMET XR tablets once daily, the median T max value for sitagliptin and metformin at steady state is approximately 3 and 8 hours postdose, respectively. The median T max value for sitagliptin and metformin after administration of a single tablet of JANUMET is 3 and 3.5 hours postdose, respectively. Effect of Food After administration of JANUMET XR tablets with a high-fat breakfast, the AUC for sitagliptin was not altered. The mean C max was decreased by 17%, although the median T max was unchanged relative to the fasted state. After administration of JANUMET XR with a high-fat breakfast, the AUC for metformin increased 62%, the C max for metformin decreased by 9%, and the median T max for metformin occurred 2 hours later relative to the fasted state. Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET XR Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET XR in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET XR Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET XR in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET XR Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET XR have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET XR (sitagliptin and metformin extended-release). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) ( Table 5 ), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

The following data are based on the findings in studies with sitagliptin and metformin individually. Sitagliptin A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total), and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Metformin Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 150, 300, and 450 mg/kg/day in males and 150, 450, 900, and 1200 mg/kg/day in females. These doses are approximately 2, 4, and 8 times in males, and 3, 7, 12, and 16 times in females of the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female rats. A carcinogenicity study was also performed in Tg.AC transgenic mice at doses up to 2000 mg applied dermally. No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in male or female mice. Genotoxicity assessments in the Ames test, gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes) and in vivo mouse micronucleus tests were negative. Fertility of male or female rats was not affected by metformin when administered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons."

There have been no clinical efficacy or safety studies conducted with JANUMET XR to characterize its effect on hemoglobin A1c (A1C) reduction. Bioequivalence of JANUMET XR tablets with coadministered sitagliptin and extended-release metformin tablets has been demonstrated for all tablet strengths [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Metformin Extended-Release Compared to Metformin Immediate-Release in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel group trial extended-release metformin HCl 1500 mg once daily, extended-release metformin HCl 1500 mg per day in divided doses (500 mg in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening), and extended-release metformin HCl 2000 mg once daily were compared to immediate-release metformin HCl 1500 mg per day in divided doses (500 mg in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening). This trial enrolled patients (n = 338) who were newly diagnosed with diabetes, patients treated only with diet and exercise, patients treated with a single anti-diabetic medication (sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or meglitinides), and patients (n = 368) receiving metformin HCl up to 1500 mg/day plus a sulfonylurea at a dose equal to or less than one-half the maximum dose. Patients who were enrolled on monotherapy or combination antidiabetic therapy underwent a 6-week washout. Patients randomized to extended-release metformin HCl began titration from 1000 mg/day up to their assigned treatment dose over 3 weeks. Patients randomized to immediate-release metformin HCl initiated 500 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 500 mg with breakfast and 1000 mg with dinner for the second week. The 3-week treatment period was followed by an additional 21-week period at the randomized dose. For HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose, each of the extended-release metformin regimens was at least as effective as immediate-release metformin. Additionally, once daily dosing of extended-release metformin was as effective as twice daily dosing of the immediate-release metformin formulation. Sitagliptin and Metformin Immediate-Release Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise A total of 1091 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release coadministration. Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive placebo, 100 mg of sitagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl immediate-release twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl immediate-release twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release coadministration provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin immediate-release alone, and to sitagliptin alone ( Table 9 , Figure 1 ). For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl immediate-release 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl immediate-release 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin immediate-release was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy should be individualized and are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Sitagliptin Add-on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Immediate-Release Alone A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with metformin immediate-release. Patients already on metformin HCl immediate-release (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin immediate-release and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl immediate-release (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin immediate-release, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin immediate-release ( Table 10 ). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) of Sitagliptin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin Immediate-Release Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl immediate-release (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin immediate-release and glimepiride had significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin immediate-release and glimepiride ( Table 11 ), with mean reductions from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.9% and in FPG of -21 mg/dL. Rescue therapy was used in 8% of patients treated with add-on sitagliptin 100 mg and 29% of patients treated with add-on placebo. The patients treated with add-on sitagliptin had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. add-on placebo (+0.4 kg vs. -0.7 kg). In addition, add-on sitagliptin resulted in an increased rate of hypoglycemia compared to add-on placebo.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl immediate-release \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl immediate-release \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl immediate-release \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin immediate-release and rosiglitazone, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin immediate-release and rosiglitazone ( Table 12 ) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with sitagliptin and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between sitagliptin and placebo in body weight change.

Approximately 75% of patients were also taking metformin immediate-release. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl immediate-release (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin (N=229) or placebo (N=233), administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. Among patients also receiving metformin immediate-release, the median daily insulin (pre-mixed, intermediate or long acting) dose at baseline was 40 units in the sitagliptin-treated patients and 42 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin immediate-release and insulin had significant improvements in A1C, FPG and 2-hour PPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin immediate-release and insulin ( Table 13 ). The adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight was -0.3 kg in patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin immediate-release and insulin and -0.2 kg in patients receiving placebo with metformin immediate-release and insulin. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with sitagliptin.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and sitagliptin (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to sitagliptin (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue sitagliptin or to discontinue sitagliptin and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group ( Table 14 ). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl immediate-release monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin immediate-release, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, sitagliptin and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis ( Table 15 ). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis ( Figure 2 ). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of sitagliptin to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 15: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing Sitagliptin to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Immediate-Release (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs. +1.1 kg). image of Figure 2"

      "WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7) ].

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take JANUMET XR orally once daily with a meal. Patients taking two JANUMET XR tablets should take the tablets together. ( 2.1 ) Individualize the dosage of JANUMET XR on the basis of the patient\u2019s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. ( 2.1 ) The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2000 mg of metformin HCl extended-release. ( 2.1 ) The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 100 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl once daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce the gastrointestinal effects due to metformin. ( 2.1 ) The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 100 mg and the dose of metformin already being taken once daily. For patients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily or 1000 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET XR is two 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl extended-release tablets once daily. ( 2.1 ) Maintain the same total daily dose of sitagliptin and metformin when changing between JANUMET and JANUMET XR. ( 2.1 ) Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ( 2.2 ) Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Discontinue if eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Initiation is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 \u2013 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Assess risk/benefit of continuing if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Limit dose of sitagliptin to 50 mg once daily if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET XR may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Take JANUMET XR orally once daily with a meal. Patients taking two JANUMET XR tablets should take the two tablets together once daily. Individualize the dosage of JANUMET XR on the basis of the patient\u2019s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2000 mg of metformin hydrochloride (HCl) extended-release. The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 100 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl extended-release once daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide 100 mg sitagliptin and the previously prescribed dose of metformin. For patients taking metformin HCl immediate-release 850 mg twice daily or 1000 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET XR is two 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl extended-release tablets taken together once daily. Maintain the same total daily dose of sitagliptin and metformin when changing between JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl immediate-release) and JANUMET XR. Do not split, crush or chew JANUMET XR tablets. 2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of JANUMET XR and periodically thereafter. JANUMET XR is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Discontinue JANUMET XR if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Initiation of JANUMET XR in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 is not recommended. In patients taking JANUMET XR whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit risk of continuing therapy and limit dose of the sitagliptin component to 50 mg once daily. 2.3 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue JANUMET XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

( 5.7 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.8 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUMET XR. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of JANUMET XR. In JANUMET XR-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis, and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue JANUMET XR and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment: The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] : Before initiating JANUMET XR, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). JANUMET XR is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Discontinue JANUMET XR if the patient's eGFR later falls below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) ] . Initiation of JANUMET XR is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . In patients taking JANUMET XR whose eGFR later falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , assess the benefit and risk of continuing therapy. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking JANUMET XR. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of JANUMET XR with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop JANUMET XR at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart JANUMET XR if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. JANUMET XR should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue JANUMET XR. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET XR. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of JANUMET XR in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking sitagliptin with or without metformin. After initiation of JANUMET XR, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUMET XR should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUMET XR. 5.3 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUMET XR prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUMET XR. 5.4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function in patients taking sitagliptin with or without metformin, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiation of therapy with JANUMET XR and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, particularly in elderly patients, renal function should be assessed more frequently and JANUMET XR discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. JANUMET XR is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.5 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on JANUMET XR and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues JANUMET XR may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) [ see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JANUMET XR [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, one of the components of JANUMET XR. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUMET XR, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema to another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUMET XR. 5.8 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.9 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUMET XR. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUMET XR should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "Drug Interactions The concomitant use of JANUMET XR with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7) ]. Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients.",
      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 presents clinically significant drug interactions with JANUMET XR: Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with JANUMET XR Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with JANUMET XR may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Intervention: Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. Examples: Topiramate, zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide. Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT 2 ] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with JANUMET XR. Examples: Ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine. Alcohol Clinical Impact: Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Intervention: Warn patients against alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET XR. Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Clinical Impact: Coadministration of JANUMET XR with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Intervention: Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin. Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. Intervention: When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving JANUMET XR, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving JANUMET XR, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia. Examples: Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring. ( 7 ) Drugs that reduce metformin clearance (such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) may increase the accumulation of metformin. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. ( 7 ) Alcohol can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake. ( 7 )"

Discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to the placebo treatment group (sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release, 1.9%; placebo and metformin immediate-release, 2.5%). Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions The incidences of pre-selected gastrointestinal adverse experiences in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release were similar to those reported for patients treated with metformin immediate-release alone.

Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin Immediate-Release and Rosiglitazone In a placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin immediate-release and rosiglitazone (sitagliptin, N=181; placebo, N=97), the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality through Week 18 in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 5.5%; placebo, 5.2%) and nasopharyngitis (6.1%, 4.1%). Through Week 54, the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin Immediate-Release and Insulin In a 24-week placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin immediate-release and insulin (sitagliptin, N=229; placebo, N=233), the only adverse reaction reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo was hypoglycemia ( Table 3 ). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=5), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required although most (77%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When the combination of sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than that observed with placebo and metformin immediate-release coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin ( Table 3 ). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required: Intent-to-treat population. (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin Immediate-Release Coadministered with Glimepiride or Insulin Add-On to Glimepiride + Metformin Immediate-Release (24 weeks) Sitagliptin 100 mg + Metformin Immediate-Release + Glimepiride Placebo + Metformin Immediate-Release + Glimepiride N = 116 N = 113 Overall (%) 19 (16.4) 1 (0.9) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.82 0.02 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin + Metformin Immediate-Release (24 weeks) Sitagliptin 100 mg + Metformin Immediate-Release + Insulin Placebo + Metformin Immediate-Release + Insulin N = 229 N = 233 Overall (%) 35 (15.3) 19 (8.2) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 0.98 0.61 Severe (%) 1 (0.4) 1 (0.4) The overall incidence of reported adverse reactions of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given sitagliptin alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin immediate-release alone, and 1.6% in patients given sitagliptin in combination with metformin immediate-release. In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin immediate-release alone, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.3% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 2.1% in patients given add-on placebo. In the study of sitagliptin and add-on combination therapy with metformin immediate-release and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In an additional 30-week placebo-controlled study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms With the combination of sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release, no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in electrocardiogram parameters (including the QTc interval) were observed. Pancreatitis In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Sitagliptin The most common adverse experience in sitagliptin monotherapy reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo was nasopharyngitis. Metformin Extended-Release In a 24-week clinical trial in which extended-release metformin or placebo was added to glyburide therapy, the most common (>5% and greater than placebo) adverse reactions in the combined treatment group were hypoglycemia (13.7% vs. 4.9%), diarrhea (12.5% vs. 5.6%), and nausea (6.7% vs. 4.2%). Laboratory Tests Sitagliptin The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%). In most but not all studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs. placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to a small increase in neutrophils. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant. Metformin In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of sitagliptin with metformin, sitagliptin, or metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome ; upper respiratory tract infection; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ]; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis) and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia; bullous pemphigoid; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury; rhabdomyolysis."

      "Laboratory Tests Sitagliptin The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%). In most but not all studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs. placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to a small increase in neutrophils. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant. Metformin In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Use: Assess renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUMET XR in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data ] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 6-times, respectively, a 2000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from post-marketing studies do not report a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups. Animal Data Sitagliptin and Metformin No animal reproduction studies were conducted with the coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin. Sitagliptin In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. Metformin Metformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUMET XR in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data ] . There are no reports of adverse effects on breastfed infants exposed to metformin. There is no information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUMET XR and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUMET XR or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. Metformin Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUMET XR have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use JANUMET XR In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. [See Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment JANUMET XR The dose of the sitagliptin component should be limited to 50 mg once daily if eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET XR is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Metformin Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. JANUMET XR is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]"

Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis. Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET XR JANUMET XR tablets combine two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin extended-release, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which exerts its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is a biguanide that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics JANUMET XR After administration of two JANUMET XR 50 mg/1000 mg tablets once daily with the evening meal for 7 days in healthy adult subjects, steady-state for sitagliptin and metformin is reached by Day 4 and 5, respectively. Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption JANUMET XR After administration of JANUMET XR tablets once daily, the median T max value for sitagliptin and metformin at steady state is approximately 3 and 8 hours postdose, respectively. The median T max value for sitagliptin and metformin after administration of a single tablet of JANUMET is 3 and 3.5 hours postdose, respectively. Effect of Food After administration of JANUMET XR tablets with a high-fat breakfast, the AUC for sitagliptin was not altered. The mean C max was decreased by 17%, although the median T max was unchanged relative to the fasted state. After administration of JANUMET XR with a high-fat breakfast, the AUC for metformin increased 62%, the C max for metformin decreased by 9%, and the median T max for metformin occurred 2 hours later relative to the fasted state. Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET XR Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET XR in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET XR Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET XR in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET XR Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET XR have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET XR (sitagliptin and metformin extended-release). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) ( Table 5 ), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET XR JANUMET XR tablets combine two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin extended-release, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which exerts its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is a biguanide that improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics JANUMET XR After administration of two JANUMET XR 50 mg/1000 mg tablets once daily with the evening meal for 7 days in healthy adult subjects, steady-state for sitagliptin and metformin is reached by Day 4 and 5, respectively. Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption JANUMET XR After administration of JANUMET XR tablets once daily, the median T max value for sitagliptin and metformin at steady state is approximately 3 and 8 hours postdose, respectively. The median T max value for sitagliptin and metformin after administration of a single tablet of JANUMET is 3 and 3.5 hours postdose, respectively. Effect of Food After administration of JANUMET XR tablets with a high-fat breakfast, the AUC for sitagliptin was not altered. The mean C max was decreased by 17%, although the median T max was unchanged relative to the fasted state. After administration of JANUMET XR with a high-fat breakfast, the AUC for metformin increased 62%, the C max for metformin decreased by 9%, and the median T max for metformin occurred 2 hours later relative to the fasted state. Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin Distribution studies with extended-release metformin have not been conducted; however, the apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of immediate-release metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) or biliary excretion. Metabolism studies with extended-release metformin tablets have not been conducted. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET XR Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET XR in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET XR Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET XR in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET XR Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET XR have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET XR (sitagliptin and metformin extended-release). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) ( Table 5 ), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

The following data are based on the findings in studies with sitagliptin and metformin individually. Sitagliptin A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total), and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Metformin Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in Sprague Dawley rats at doses of 150, 300, and 450 mg/kg/day in males and 150, 450, 900, and 1200 mg/kg/day in females. These doses are approximately 2, 4, and 8 times in males, and 3, 7, 12, and 16 times in females of the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female rats. A carcinogenicity study was also performed in Tg.AC transgenic mice at doses up to 2000 mg applied dermally. No evidence of carcinogenicity was observed in male or female mice. Genotoxicity assessments in the Ames test, gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes) and in vivo mouse micronucleus tests were negative. Fertility of male or female rats was not affected by metformin when administered at doses up to 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 3 times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise and in combination with other antidiabetic medications. There have been no clinical efficacy or safety studies conducted with JANUMET XR to characterize its effect on hemoglobin A1c (A1C) reduction. Bioequivalence of JANUMET XR tablets with coadministered sitagliptin and extended-release metformin tablets has been demonstrated for all tablet strengths [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Metformin Extended-Release Compared to Metformin Immediate-Release in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, dose-ranging, parallel group trial extended-release metformin HCl 1500 mg once daily, extended-release metformin HCl 1500 mg per day in divided doses (500 mg in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening), and extended-release metformin HCl 2000 mg once daily were compared to immediate-release metformin HCl 1500 mg per day in divided doses (500 mg in the morning and 1000 mg in the evening). This trial enrolled patients (n = 338) who were newly diagnosed with diabetes, patients treated only with diet and exercise, patients treated with a single anti-diabetic medication (sulfonylureas, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, or meglitinides), and patients (n = 368) receiving metformin HCl up to 1500 mg/day plus a sulfonylurea at a dose equal to or less than one-half the maximum dose. Patients who were enrolled on monotherapy or combination antidiabetic therapy underwent a 6-week washout. Patients randomized to extended-release metformin HCl began titration from 1000 mg/day up to their assigned treatment dose over 3 weeks. Patients randomized to immediate-release metformin HCl initiated 500 mg twice daily for 1 week followed by 500 mg with breakfast and 1000 mg with dinner for the second week. The 3-week treatment period was followed by an additional 21-week period at the randomized dose. For HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose, each of the extended-release metformin regimens was at least as effective as immediate-release metformin. Additionally, once daily dosing of extended-release metformin was as effective as twice daily dosing of the immediate-release metformin formulation. Sitagliptin and Metformin Immediate-Release Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise A total of 1091 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release coadministration. Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive placebo, 100 mg of sitagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl immediate-release twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl immediate-release twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Sitagliptin and metformin immediate-release coadministration provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin immediate-release alone, and to sitagliptin alone ( Table 9 , Figure 1 ). For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl immediate-release 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl immediate-release 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl immediate-release 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin immediate-release was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy should be individualized and are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Sitagliptin Add-on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Immediate-Release Alone A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with metformin immediate-release. Patients already on metformin HCl immediate-release (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin immediate-release and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl immediate-release (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin immediate-release, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin immediate-release ( Table 10 ). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) of Sitagliptin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin Immediate-Release Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl immediate-release (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin immediate-release and glimepiride had significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin immediate-release and glimepiride ( Table 11 ), with mean reductions from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.9% and in FPG of -21 mg/dL. Rescue therapy was used in 8% of patients treated with add-on sitagliptin 100 mg and 29% of patients treated with add-on placebo. The patients treated with add-on sitagliptin had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. add-on placebo (+0.4 kg vs. -0.7 kg). In addition, add-on sitagliptin resulted in an increased rate of hypoglycemia compared to add-on placebo.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl immediate-release \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl immediate-release \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl immediate-release \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin immediate-release and rosiglitazone, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin immediate-release and rosiglitazone ( Table 12 ) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with sitagliptin and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between sitagliptin and placebo in body weight change.

Approximately 75% of patients were also taking metformin immediate-release. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl immediate-release (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin (N=229) or placebo (N=233), administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. Among patients also receiving metformin immediate-release, the median daily insulin (pre-mixed, intermediate or long acting) dose at baseline was 40 units in the sitagliptin-treated patients and 42 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin immediate-release and insulin had significant improvements in A1C, FPG and 2-hour PPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin immediate-release and insulin ( Table 13 ). The adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight was -0.3 kg in patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin immediate-release and insulin and -0.2 kg in patients receiving placebo with metformin immediate-release and insulin. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with sitagliptin.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and sitagliptin (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to sitagliptin (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue sitagliptin or to discontinue sitagliptin and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group ( Table 14 ). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl immediate-release monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin immediate-release, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, sitagliptin and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis ( Table 15 ). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis ( Figure 2 ). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of sitagliptin to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 15: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing Sitagliptin to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Immediate-Release (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs. +1.1 kg). image of Figure 2"

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Lactic Acidosis Explain the risks of lactic acidosis, its symptoms, and conditions that predispose to its development. Advise patients to discontinue JANUMET XR immediately and to promptly notify their healthcare provider if unexplained hyperventilation, myalgias, malaise, unusual somnolence or other nonspecific symptoms occur. Counsel patients against excessive alcohol intake and inform patients about the importance of regular testing of renal function while receiving JANUMET XR. Instruct patients to inform their doctor that they are taking JANUMET XR prior to any surgical or radiological procedure, as temporary discontinuation may be required [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Pancreatitis Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during postmarketing use of JANUMET XR. Inform patients that persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue JANUMET XR and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ]. Heart Failure Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of heart failure. Before initiating JANUMET XR, ask patients about a history of heart failure or other risk factors for heart failure including moderate to severe renal impairment. Instruct patients to contact their health care provider as soon as possible if they experience symptoms of heart failure, including increasing shortness of breath, rapid increase in weight or swelling of the feet [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Vitamin B 12 Deficiency Inform patients about the importance of regular monitoring of hematological parameters while receiving JANUMET XR [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ]. Hypoglycemia Inform patients that the incidence of hypoglycemia is increased when sitagliptin with or without metformin is added to an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin therapy. Explain to patients receiving JANUMET XR in combination with these medications the risks of hypoglycemia, its symptoms and treatment and conditions that predispose to its development [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Hypersensitivity Reactions Inform patients that allergic reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of sitagliptin, one of the components of JANUMET XR. If symptoms of allergic reactions (including rash, hives, and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause difficulty in breathing or swallowing) occur, patients must stop taking JANUMET XR and seek medical advice promptly. Severe and Disabling Arthralgia Inform patients that severe and disabling joint pain may occur with this class of drugs. The time to onset of symptoms can range from one day to years. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if severe joint pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] . Bullous Pemphigoid Inform patients that bullous pemphigoid may occur with this class of drugs.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05)."

No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] ."

In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to metformin rescue therapy. JANUVIA 100 mg + Pioglitazone Placebo + Pioglitazone A1C (%) N = 163 N = 174 Baseline (mean) 8.1 8.0 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline value. ) -0.9 -0.2 Difference from placebo + pioglitazone (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -0.7 p<0.001 compared to placebo + pioglitazone. (-0.9, -0.5) Patients (%) achieving A1C <7% 74 (45%) 40 (23%) FPG (mg/dL) N = 163 N = 174 Baseline (mean) 168 166 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -17 1 Difference from placebo + pioglitazone (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -18 (-24, -11) Initial Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 520 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as initial therapy in combination with pioglitazone. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral. Table 11: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA in Combination with Pioglitazone as Initial Therapy Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study. JANUVIA 100 mg + Pioglitazone Pioglitazone A1C (%) N = 251 N = 246 Baseline (mean) 9.5 9.4 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for baseline value. ) -2.4 -1.5 Difference from pioglitazone (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -0.9 p<0.001 compared to placebo + pioglitazone.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy. JANUVIA 100 mg + Metformin + Rosiglitazone Placebo + Metformin + Rosiglitazone A1C (%) N = 176 N = 93 Baseline (mean) 8.8 8.7 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline value. ) -1.0 -0.4 Difference from placebo + rosiglitazone + metformin (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -0.7 p<0.001 compared to placebo + metformin + rosiglitazone. (-0.9, -0.4) Patients (%) achieving A1C <7% 39 (22%) 9 (10%) FPG (mg/dL) N = 179 N = 94 Baseline (mean) 181 182 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -30 -11 Difference from placebo + rosiglitazone + metformin (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -18 (-26, -10) 2-hour PPG (mg/dL) N = 152 N = 80 Baseline (mean) 256 248 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -59 -21 Difference from placebo + rosiglitazone + metformin (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -39 (-51, -26) Add-on Combination Therapy with Glimepiride, with or without Metformin A total of 441 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin. Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 13: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-On Combination Therapy with Glimepiride, with or without Metformin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling ( Medication Guide ). Pancreatitis Inform patients that acute pancreatitis has been reported during postmarketing use of JANUVIA. Inform patients that persistent severe abdominal pain, sometimes radiating to the back, which may or may not be accompanied by vomiting, is the hallmark symptom of acute pancreatitis. Instruct patients to promptly discontinue JANUVIA and contact their physician if persistent severe abdominal pain occurs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Heart Failure Inform patients of the signs and symptoms of heart failure.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) \u2022 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3. Table 1: Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of JANUVIA Monotherapy or Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone, Metformin + Rosiglitazone, or Glimepiride +/- Metformin: Adverse Reactions (Excluding Hypoglycemia) Reported in \u22655% of Patients and More Commonly than in Patients Given Placebo, Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Intent-to-treat population Number of Patients (%) Monotherapy (18 or 24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg Placebo N = 443 N = 363 Nasopharyngitis 23 (5.2) 12 (3.3) Combination with Pioglitazone (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Pioglitazone Placebo + Pioglitazone N = 175 N = 178 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 11 (6.3) 6 (3.4) Headache 9 (5.1) 7 (3.9) Combination with Metformin + Rosiglitazone (18 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Metformin + Rosiglitazone Placebo + Metformin + Rosiglitazone N = 181 N = 97 Upper Respiratory Tract Infection 10 (5.5) 5 (5.2) Nasopharyngitis 11 (6.1) 4 (4.1) Combination with Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Nasopharyngitis 14 (6.3) 10 (4.6) Headache 13 (5.9) 5 (2.3) In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin, there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo. In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin (JANUVIA) 100 mg QD Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin. Sitagliptin 50 mg bid + Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid N = 176 N = 179 N = 364 N = 372 Upper Respiratory Infection 9 (5.1) 8 (4.5) 19 (5.2) 23 (6.2) Headache 5 (2.8) 2 (1.1) 14 (3.8) 22 (5.9) In a 24-week study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone, there were no adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given pioglitazone alone. No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups. Table 7: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to metformin rescue therapy. JANUVIA 100 mg + Pioglitazone Placebo + Pioglitazone A1C (%) N = 163 N = 174 Baseline (mean) 8.1 8.0 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline value. ) -0.9 -0.2 Difference from placebo + pioglitazone (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -0.7 p<0.001 compared to placebo + pioglitazone.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral. Table 11: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA in Combination with Pioglitazone as Initial Therapy Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study. JANUVIA 100 mg + Pioglitazone Pioglitazone A1C (%) N = 251 N = 246 Baseline (mean) 9.5 9.4 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for baseline value. ) -2.4 -1.5 Difference from pioglitazone (adjusted mean ) (95% CI) -0.9 p<0.001 compared to placebo + pioglitazone.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 13: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-On Combination Therapy with Glimepiride, with or without Metformin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take JANUMET orally twice daily with meals. ( 2.1 ) Individualize the dosage of JANUMET on the basis of the patient\u2019s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. ( 2.1 ) The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2000 mg of metformin HCl. ( 2.1 ) The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. ( 2.1 ) The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl twice daily. ( 2.1 ) Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ( 2.2 ) Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Take JANUMET orally twice daily with meals. Individualize the dosage of JANUMET on the basis of the patient\u2019s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2000 mg of metformin hydrochloride (HCl). Do not split or divide JANUMET tablets. The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl twice daily. 2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of JANUMET and periodically thereafter. JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination JANUMET product. 2.3 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue JANUMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

Consider risks and benefits of JANUMET in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiating JANUMET and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function. ( 5.4 ) Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.5 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUMET, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.7 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.8 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUMET. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of JANUMET. In JANUMET-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue JANUMET and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] : Before initiating JANUMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) ]. JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination JANUMET product. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking JANUMET. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of JANUMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop JANUMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart JANUMET if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. JANUMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue JANUMET. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of JANUMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUMET. After initiation of JANUMET, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUMET should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUMET. 5.3 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUMET prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUMET. 5.4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiation of therapy with JANUMET and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, particularly in elderly patients, renal function should be assessed more frequently and JANUMET discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.5 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on JANUMET and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues JANUMET may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JANUMET [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, one of the components of JANUMET. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUMET, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUMET. 5.8 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.9 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUMET. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUMET should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise Table 1 summarizes the most common (\u22655% of patients) adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in a 24-week placebo-controlled factorial study in which sitagliptin and metformin were coadministered to patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise. Table 1: Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministered to Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily Metformin HCl 500 mg/ Metformin HCl 1000 mg twice daily Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin.

Discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to the placebo treatment group (sitagliptin and metformin, 1.9%; placebo and metformin, 2.5%). Gastrointestinal Adverse Reactions The incidences of pre-selected gastrointestinal adverse experiences in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin were similar to those reported for patients treated with metformin alone. See Table 2 .

Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Rosiglitazone In a placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and rosiglitazone (sitagliptin, N=181; placebo, N=97), the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality through Week 18 in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 5.5%; placebo, 5.2%) and nasopharyngitis (6.1%, 4.1%). Through Week 54, the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Insulin In a 24-week placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and insulin (sitagliptin, N=229; placebo, N=233), the only adverse reaction reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo was hypoglycemia (Table 3). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=5), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required although most (77%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than that observed with placebo and metformin coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required: Intent-to-treat population. (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin Coadministered with Glimepiride or Insulin Add-On to Glimepiride + Metformin (24 weeks) Sitagliptin 100 mg + Metformin + Glimepiride Placebo + Metformin + Glimepiride N = 116 N = 113 Overall (%) 19 (16.4) 1 (0.9) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.82 0.02 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin + Metformin (24 weeks) Sitagliptin 100 mg + Metformin + Insulin Placebo + Metformin + Insulin N = 229 N = 233 Overall (%) 35 (15.3) 19 (8.2) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 0.98 0.61 Severe (%) 1 (0.4) 1 (0.4) The overall incidence of reported adverse reactions of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given sitagliptin alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given sitagliptin in combination with metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin alone, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.3% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 2.1% in patients given add-on placebo. In the study of sitagliptin and add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms With the combination of sitagliptin and metformin, no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed. Pancreatitis In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Sitagliptin The most common adverse experience in sitagliptin monotherapy reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo was nasopharyngitis. Metformin The most common (>5%) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. Laboratory Tests Sitagliptin The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%). In most but not all studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to a small increase in neutrophils. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant. Metformin In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUMET, sitagliptin, or metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome ; upper respiratory tract infection; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ]; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis) and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia; bullous pemphigoid; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury; rhabdomyolysis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 presents clinically significant drug interactions with JANUMET: Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with JANUMET Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with JANUMET may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Intervention: Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. Examples: Topiramate, zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide. Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT 2 ] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with JANUMET. Examples: Ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine. Alcohol Clinical Impact: Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Intervention: Warn patients against alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET. Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Clinical Impact: Coadministration of JANUMET with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Intervention: Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin. Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. Intervention: When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving JANUMET, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving JANUMET, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia. Examples: Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring. ( 7 ) Drugs that reduce metformin clearance (such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) may increase the accumulation of metformin. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. ( 7 ) Alcohol can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Use: Assess renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUMET in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data ] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 6-times, respectively, a 2000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20% respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from post-marketing studies do not report a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups. Animal Data Sitagliptin and Metformin No animal reproduction studies were conducted with the coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin. Sitagliptin In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. Metformin Metformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUMET in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data ] . There are no reports of adverse effects on breastfed infants exposed to metformin. There is no information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUMET and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUMET or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. Metformin Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUMET have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use JANUMET In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. [See Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment JANUMET JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed dose combination JANUMET product. JANUMET is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Metformin Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. JANUMET is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]"

      "8.5 Geriatric Use JANUMET In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. [See Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose with JANUMET, contact the Poison Control Center. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as indicated by the patient's clinical status. Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis. Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET JANUMET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2219hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin HCl tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 5), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET JANUMET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2219hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin HCl tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 5), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

The following data are based on the findings in studies with sitagliptin and metformin individually. Sitagliptin A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total), and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Metformin Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test ( S. typhimurium ), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. None of the clinical efficacy studies described below was conducted with JANUMET; however, bioequivalence of JANUMET with coadministered sitagliptin and metformin HCl tablets was demonstrated. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise A total of 1091 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin and metformin coadministration. Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive placebo, 100 mg of sitagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Sitagliptin and metformin coadministration provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to sitagliptin alone (Table 9, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy should be individualized and are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Sitagliptin Add-on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Alone A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 10). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) of Sitagliptin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and glimepiride had significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and glimepiride (Table 11), with mean reductions from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.9% and in FPG of -21 mg/dL. Rescue therapy was used in 8% of patients treated with add-on sitagliptin 100 mg and 29% of patients treated with add-on placebo. The patients treated with add-on sitagliptin had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. add-on placebo (+0.4 kg vs. -0.7 kg). In addition, add-on sitagliptin resulted in an increased rate of hypoglycemia compared to add-on placebo.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with sitagliptin and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between sitagliptin and placebo in body weight change.

Approximately 75% of patients were also taking metformin. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin (N=229) or placebo (N=233), administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. Among patients also receiving metformin, the median daily insulin (pre-mixed, intermediate or long acting) dose at baseline was 40 units in the sitagliptin-treated patients and 42 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin had significant improvements in A1C, FPG and 2-hour PPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin (Table 13). The adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight was -0.3 kg in patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin and -0.2 kg in patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with sitagliptin.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and sitagliptin (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to sitagliptin (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue sitagliptin or to discontinue sitagliptin and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 14). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, sitagliptin and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 15). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of sitagliptin to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C less than 8% and over 90% had A1C less than 9%). Table 15: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing Sitagliptin to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs. +1.1 kg).

      "Medication Guide JANUMET \u00ae (JAN-you-met) (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride) tablets, for oral use This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 07/2022 Read this Medication Guide carefully before you start taking JANUMET and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. If you have any questions about JANUMET, ask your doctor or pharmacist. What is the most important information I should know about JANUMET? JANUMET can cause serious side effects , including: 1. Lactic Acidosis. Metformin, one of the medicines in JANUMET, can cause a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis (a buildup of an acid in the blood) that can cause death. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in the hospital. Stop taking JANUMET and call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms, which could be signs of lactic acidosis: you feel cold in your hands or feet you feel dizzy or lightheaded you have a slow or irregular heartbeat you feel very weak or tired you have unusual (not normal) muscle pain you have trouble breathing you feel sleepy or drowsy you have stomach pains, nausea or vomiting Most people who have had lactic acidosis with metformin have other things that, combined with the metformin, led to the lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following, because you have a higher chance for getting lactic acidosis with JANUMET if you: have severe kidney problems or your kidneys are affected by certain x-ray tests that use injectable dye have liver problems drink alcohol very often, or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term \"binge\" drinking get dehydrated (lose a large amount of body fluids). This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis: Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis, as indicated. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels and discontinue STEGLUJAN if ketoacidosis is suspected. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting. ( 5.1 ) Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis in patients taking sitagliptin, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue. ( 5.2 ) Lower Limb Amputation: Monitor patients for infections or ulcers of lower limbs, and discontinue if these occur. ( 5.3 ) Acute Renal Failure: There have been postmarketing reports of acute renal failure in patients taking sitagliptin, sometimes requiring dialysis. Monitor renal function. ( 5.4 ) Volume Depletion: May result in acute kidney injury. Before initiating, assess and correct volume status in patients with renal impairment, or low systolic blood pressure elderly patients, or patients on diuretics. Monitor for signs and symptoms during therapy. ( 5.5 ) Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis: Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated. ( 5.6 ) Heart Failure: Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.7 ) Hypoglycemia: Consider a lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue to reduce risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination. ( 5.8 ) Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene): Serious, life-threatening cases have occurred in both females and males. Assess patients presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise. If suspected, institute prompt treatment. ( 5.9 ) Genital Mycotic Infections: Monitor and treat if indicated. ( 5.10 ) Hypersensitivity: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In such cases, promptly discontinue, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment, and initiate alternative treatment for diabetes. ( 5.11 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Severe and disabling arthralgia has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue if appropriate. ( 5.12 ) Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue. ( 5.13 ) 5.1 Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus and Other Ketoacidosis In patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, STEGLUJAN significantly increases the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening event, beyond the background rate. In placebo-controlled trials of patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, the risk of ketoacidosis was markedly increased in patients who received sodium glucose transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors compared to patients who received placebo; this risk may be greater with higher doses. STEGLUJAN is not indicated for glycemic control in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Type 2 diabetes mellitus and pancreatic disorders (e.g., history of pancreatitis or pancreatic surgery) are also risk factors for ketoacidosis. There have been postmarketing reports of fatal events of ketoacidosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus using SGLT2 inhibitors. Precipitating conditions for diabetic ketoacidosis or other ketoacidosis include under-insulinization due to insulin dose reduction or missed insulin doses, acute febrile illness, reduced caloric intake, ketogenic diet, surgery, volume depletion, and alcohol abuse. Signs and symptoms are consistent with dehydration and severe metabolic acidosis and include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, generalized malaise, and shortness of breath. Blood glucose levels at presentation may be below those typically expected for diabetic ketoacidosis (e.g., less than 250 mg/dL). Ketoacidosis and glucosuria may persist longer than typically expected. Urinary glucose excretion persists for 4 days after discontinuing STEGLUJAN [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]; however, there have been postmarketing reports of ketoacidosis and/or glucosuria lasting greater than 6 days and some up to 2 weeks after discontinuation of SGLT2 inhibitors. Consider ketone monitoring in patients at risk for ketoacidosis if indicated by the clinical situation. Assess for ketoacidosis regardless of presenting blood glucose levels in patients who present with signs and symptoms consistent with severe metabolic acidosis. If ketoacidosis is suspected, discontinue STEGLUJAN, promptly evaluate, and treat ketoacidosis, if confirmed. Monitor patients for resolution of ketoacidosis before restarting STEGLUJAN. Withhold STEGLUJAN, if possible, in temporary clinical situations that could predispose patients to ketoacidosis. Resume STEGLUJAN when the patient is clinically stable and has resumed oral intake [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ]. Educate all patients on the signs and symptoms of ketoacidosis and instruct patients to discontinue STEGLUJAN and seek medical attention immediately if signs and symptoms occur. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking sitagliptin, a component of STEGLUJAN. After initiation of STEGLUJAN, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, STEGLUJAN should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using STEGLUJAN. 5.3 Lower Limb Amputation In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes study [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] , in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and established cardiovascular disease, the occurrence of non-traumatic lower limb amputations was reported with event rates of 4.7, 5.7, and 6.0 events per 1000 patient-years in the placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg treatment arms, respectively. Amputation of the toe and foot were most frequent (81 out of 109 patients with lower limb amputations). Some patients had multiple amputations, some involving both lower limbs. Lower limb infections, gangrene, and diabetic foot ulcers were the most common precipitating medical events leading to the need for an amputation. Patients with amputations were more likely to be male, have higher A1C (%) at baseline, have a history of peripheral arterial disease, amputation or peripheral revascularization procedure, diabetic foot, and to have been taking diuretics or insulin. Across seven ertugliflozin clinical trials, non-traumatic lower limb amputations were reported in 1 (0.1%) patient in the comparator group, 3 (0.2%) patients in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, and 8 (0.5%) patients in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. Counsel patients about the importance of routine preventative foot care. Monitor patients receiving STEGLUJAN for signs and symptoms of infection (including osteomyelitis), new pain or tenderness, sores or ulcers involving the lower limbs, and discontinue STEGLUJAN if these complications occur. 5.4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports with sitagliptin of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal insufficiency, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal insufficiency has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating STEGLUJAN if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Sitagliptin has not been found to be nephrotoxic in preclinical studies at clinically relevant doses, or in clinical trials. 5.5 Volume Depletion STEGLUJAN can cause intravascular volume contraction which may sometimes manifest as symptomatic hypotension or acute transient changes in creatinine [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . There have been postmarketing reports of acute kidney injury, some requiring hospitalization and dialysis, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including STEGLUJAN. Patients with impaired renal function (eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] , elderly patients, patients with low systolic blood pressure, or patients on loop diuretics may be at increased risk for volume depletion or hypotension. Before initiating STEGLUJAN in patients with one or more of these characteristics, assess volume status and renal function. In patients with volume depletion, correct this condition before initiating STEGLUJAN. Monitor for signs and symptoms of volume depletion, and renal function after initiating therapy. 5.6 Urosepsis and Pyelonephritis There have been postmarketing reports of serious urinary tract infections, including urosepsis and pyelonephritis, requiring hospitalization in patients receiving medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors. Treatment with medicines containing SGLT2 inhibitors increases the risk for urinary tract infections. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections and treat promptly, if indicated [see Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 5.7 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of STEGLUJAN prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of STEGLUJAN. 5.8 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues Insulin and insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea) are known to cause hypoglycemia. Ertugliflozin, may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin or an insulin secretagogue [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The risk of hypoglycemia may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of insulin or sulfonylurea (or other concomitantly administered insulin secretagogues). Inform patients using these medications concomitantly of this risk and educate them on the signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia. 5.9 Necrotizing Fasciitis of the Perineum (Fournier's Gangrene) Reports of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier's Gangrene), a rare but serious and life-threatening necrotizing infection requiring urgent surgical intervention, have been identified in postmarketing surveillance in patients with diabetes mellitus receiving SGLT2 inhibitors, including ertugliflozin. Cases have been reported in females and males. Serious outcomes have included hospitalization, multiple surgeries, and death. Patients treated with STEGLUJAN presenting with pain or tenderness, erythema, or swelling in the genital or perineal area, along with fever or malaise, should be assessed for necrotizing fasciitis. If suspected, start treatment immediately with broad-spectrum antibiotics and, if necessary, surgical debridement. Discontinue STEGLUJAN, closely monitor blood glucose levels, and provide appropriate alternative therapy for glycemic control. 5.10 Genital Mycotic Infections Ertugliflozin, increases the risk of genital mycotic infections. Patients who have a history of genital mycotic infections or who are uncircumcised are more likely to develop genital mycotic infections [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor and treat appropriately. 5.11 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue STEGLUJAN, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes [see Adverse Reactions (6.2) ] . Angioedema has also been reported with other dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with STEGLUJAN. 5.12 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.13 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving STEGLUJAN. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, STEGLUJAN should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

( 6.1 ) Most common adverse reactions associated with sitagliptin (incidence \u22655%): upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with sitagliptin compared to placebo.

Ertugliflozin and Sitagliptin The safety of concomitantly administered ertugliflozin and sitagliptin has been evaluated in 990 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated for 26 weeks in three studies; a factorial study of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily compared to the individual components, a placebo-controlled study of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg as add-on therapy to sitagliptin 100 mg and metformin HCl once daily, and a placebo-controlled study of initial therapy with ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg once daily in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . The incidence and type of adverse reactions in these three studies were similar to the adverse reactions seen with ertugliflozin and described below in Table 1 . Ertugliflozin Pool of Placebo-Controlled Trials The data in Table 1 are derived from a pool of three 26-week, placebo-controlled trials. Ertugliflozin was used as monotherapy in one trial and as add-on therapy in two trials [see Clinical Studies (14) ] . These data reflect exposure of 1,029 patients to ertugliflozin with a mean exposure duration of approximately 25 weeks. Patients received ertugliflozin 5 mg (N=519), ertugliflozin 15 mg (N=510), or placebo (N=515) once daily. The mean age of the population was 57 years and 2% were older than 75 years of age. Fifty-three percent (53%) of the population was male and 73% were White, 15% were Asian, and 7% were Black or African American. At baseline the population had diabetes for an average of 7.5 years, had a mean HbA1c of 8.1%, and 19.4% had established microvascular complications of diabetes. Baseline renal function (mean eGFR 88.9 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) was normal or mildly impaired in 97% of patients and moderately impaired in 3% of patients. Table 1 shows common adverse reactions associated with the use of ertugliflozin. These adverse reactions were not present at baseline, occurred more commonly on ertugliflozin than on placebo, and occurred in at least 2% of patients treated with either ertugliflozin 5 mg or ertugliflozin 15 mg. Table 1: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Treated with Ertugliflozin The three placebo controlled studies included one monotherapy trial and two add-on combination trials with metformin HCl or with metformin HCl and sitagliptin. and Greater than Placebo in Pooled Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of Ertugliflozin Monotherapy or Combination Therapy Number (%) of Patients Placebo N = 515 Ertugliflozin 5 mg N = 519 Ertugliflozin 15 mg N = 510 Female genital mycotic infections Includes: genital candidiasis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, and vulvovaginitis.

In patients with moderate renal impairment, adverse reactions related to volume depletion (e.g., dehydration, dizziness postural, presyncope, syncope, hypotension, and orthostatic hypotension) were reported in 0%, 4.4%, and 1.9% of patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. Ertugliflozin may also increase the risk of hypotension in other patients at risk for volume contraction [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5 , 8.6) ] . Hypoglycemia The incidence of hypoglycemia by study is shown in Table 2 .

Across seven ertugliflozin clinical trials, non-traumatic lower limb amputations were reported in 1 (0.1%) patient in the comparator group, 3 (0.2%) patients in the ertugliflozin 5 mg group, and 8 (0.5%) patients in the ertugliflozin 15 mg group. Genital Mycotic Infections In the pool of three placebo-controlled clinical trials, the incidence of female genital mycotic infections (e.g., genital candidiasis, genital infection fungal, vaginal infection, vulvitis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, vulvovaginal mycotic infection, vulvovaginitis) occurred in 3%, 9.1%, and 12.2% of females treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively (see Table 1 ). In females, discontinuation due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.6% of patients treated with placebo and ertugliflozin, respectively. In the same pool, male genital mycotic infections (e.g., balanitis candida, balanoposthitis, genital infection, genital infection fungal) occurred in 0.4%, 3.7%, and 4.2% of males treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively (see Table 1 ). Male genital mycotic infections occurred more commonly in uncircumcised males. In males, discontinuations due to genital mycotic infections occurred in 0% and 0.2% of patients treated with placebo and ertugliflozin, respectively. Phimosis was reported in 8 of 1,729 (0.5%) male ertugliflozin-treated patients, of which four required circumcision. Urinary Tract Infections In VERTIS CV, urinary tract infections (e.g., urinary tract infection, cystitis, dysuria) occurred in 10.2%, 12.2% and 12.0% of patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. The incidences of serious urinary tract infections were 0.8%, 0.9% and 0.4% with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. Sitagliptin The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in clinical studies with sitagliptin: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, headache, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea. In addition, in a study of sitagliptin as add-on combination therapy with metformin HCl and rosiglitazone, peripheral edema was noted with a higher incidence than placebo. In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin HCl study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with sitagliptin compared to placebo. In the add-on to glimepiride (+/- metformin HCl) study, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 12.2% in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 1.8% in patients treated with placebo. In the add-on to insulin (+/- metformin HCl) study, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 15.5% in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 7.8% in patients treated with placebo. In all studies, adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5,429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4,817), the incidence of non-adjudicated acute pancreatitis events was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4,708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3,942 patient-years for control). Laboratory Tests Ertugliflozin Changes in Serum Creatinine and eGFR Initiation of ertugliflozin causes an increase in serum creatinine and decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy and then these changes stabilize. In a study of patients with moderate renal impairment, larger mean changes were observed. In a long-term cardiovascular outcomes trial, an initial increase in serum creatinine and a decrease in eGFR within weeks of starting therapy was observed (at Week 6 eGFR changes of -2.7, -3.8 and -0.4 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in the ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg and placebo arms, respectively). The initial decline was followed by a recovery toward baseline to Week 52 (eGFR change from baseline of - 0.4, - 1.1 and - 0.2 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, and placebo arms, respectively). Acute hemodynamic changes may play a role in the early renal function changes observed with ertugliflozin since they are reversed after treatment discontinuation. Increases in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, dose-related increases in LDL-C were observed in patients treated with ertugliflozin. Mean percent changes from baseline to Week 26 in LDL-C relative to placebo were 2.6% and 5.4% with ertugliflozin 5 mg and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively. The range of mean baseline LDL-C was 96.6 to 97.7 mg/dL across treatment groups. Increases in Hemoglobin In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline to Week 26 in hemoglobin were -0.21 g/dL (-1.4%) with placebo, 0.46 g/dL (3.5%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.48 g/dL (3.5%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg. The range of mean baseline hemoglobin was 13.90 to 14.00 g/dL across treatment groups. At the end of treatment, 0.0%, 0.2%, and 0.4% of patients treated with placebo, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively, had a hemoglobin increase greater than 2 g/dL and above the upper limit of normal. Increases in Serum Phosphate In the pool of three placebo-controlled trials, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline in serum phosphate were 0.04 mg/dL (1.9%) with placebo, 0.21 mg/dL (6.8%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.26 mg/dL (8.5%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg. The range of mean baseline serum phosphate was 3.53 to 3.54 mg/dL across treatment groups. In a clinical trial of patients with moderate renal impairment, mean changes (percent changes) from baseline at Week 26 in serum phosphate were -0.01 mg/dL (0.8%) with placebo, 0.29 mg/dL (9.7%) with ertugliflozin 5 mg, and 0.24 mg/dL (7.8%) with ertugliflozin 15 mg. Sitagliptin Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs. placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6,600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to sitagliptin 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with sitagliptin [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of ertugliflozin or sitagliptin, both components of STEGLUJAN. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Ertugliflozin Infections: necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum (Fournier\u2019s Gangrene) Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: angioedema, rash Sitagliptin Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, bullous pemphigoid, exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and pruritus Investigations: hepatic enzyme elevations Gastrointestinal Disorders: acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis, constipation, vomiting, mouth ulceration, and stomatitis Renal and Urinary Disorders: worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders: severe and disabling arthralgia, myalgia, pain in extremity, back pain, and rhabdomyolysis Nervous System Disorders: headache"

Intervention: A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with STEGLUJAN. Lithium Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of an SGLT2 inhibitor with lithium may decrease serum lithium concentrations. Intervention: Monitor serum lithium concentration more frequently during STEGLUJAN initiation and dosage changes.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Pregnancy: Advise females of the potential risk to a fetus especially during the second and third trimesters. ( 8.1 ) Lactation: Breastfeeding not recommended. ( 8.2 ) Geriatrics: Higher incidence of adverse reactions related to reduced intravascular volume. ( 8.5 ) Renal Impairment: Higher incidence of adverse reactions related to reduced intravascular volume and renal function. ( 8.6 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on animal data showing adverse renal effects, from ertugliflozin, STEGLUJAN is not recommended during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. The limited available data with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin use during pregnancy are not sufficient to determine a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy (see Clinical Considerations ) . In animal studies, adverse renal changes were observed in rats when ertugliflozin was administered during a period of renal development corresponding to the late second and third trimesters of human pregnancy. Doses approximately 13 times the maximum clinical dose caused renal pelvic and tubule dilatations and renal mineralization that were not fully reversible. There was no evidence of fetal harm in rats or rabbits at exposures of ertugliflozin approximately 300 times higher than the maximal clinical dose of 15 mg/day when administered during organogenesis (see Data ) . In rats and rabbits, sitagliptin doses of 250 and 125 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 30 and 20 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose) did not adversely affect development outcomes of either species. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, stillbirth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data Ertugliflozin When ertugliflozin was orally administered to juvenile rats from PND 21 to PND 90, increased kidney weight, renal tubule and renal pelvis dilatation, and renal mineralization occurred at doses greater than or equal to 5 mg/kg (13-fold human exposures, based on AUC). These effects occurred with drug exposure during periods of renal development in rats that correspond to the late second and third trimester of human renal development, and did not fully reverse within a 1-month recovery period. In embryo-fetal development studies, ertugliflozin (50, 100 and 250 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to rats on gestation days 6 to 17 and to rabbits on gestation days 7 to 19. Ertugliflozin did not adversely affect developmental outcomes in rats and rabbits at maternal exposures that were approximately 300 times the human exposure at the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on AUC. A maternally toxic dose (250 mg/kg/day) in rats (707 times the clinical dose) was associated with reduced fetal viability, and a higher incidence of a visceral malformation (membranous ventricular septal defect). In the pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant rats, ertugliflozin was administered to the dams from gestation day 6 through lactation day 21 (weaning). Decreased post-natal growth (weight gain) was observed at maternal doses \u2265100 mg/kg/day (greater than or equal to 331 times the human exposure at the maximum clinical dose of 15 mg/day, based on AUC). Sitagliptin Sitagliptin administered to pregnant female rats and rabbits from gestation day 6 to 20 (organogenesis) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (rats) and 125 mg/kg (rabbits), or approximately 30 and 20 times human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Higher doses increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1,000 mg/kg, or approximately 100 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 decreased body weight in male and female offspring at 1,000 mg/kg. No functional or behavioral toxicity was observed in offspring of rats. Placental transfer of sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats was approximately 45% at 2 hours and 80% at 24 hours postdose. Placental transfer of sitagliptin administered to pregnant rabbits was approximately 66% at 2 hours and 30% at 24 hours. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of STEGLUJAN, in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Ertugliflozin and sitagliptin are present in the milk of lactating rats (see Data ) . Since human kidney maturation occurs in utero and during the first 2 years of life when lactational exposure may occur, there may be risk to the developing human kidney, based on data with ertugliflozin. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed infant, advise women that the use of STEGLUJAN is not recommended while breastfeeding. Data Ertugliflozin The lacteal excretion of radiolabeled ertugliflozin in lactating rats was evaluated 10 to 12 days after parturition. Ertugliflozin-derived radioactivity exposure in milk and plasma were similar, with a milk/plasma ratio of 1.07, based on AUC. Juvenile rats directly exposed to ertugliflozin during a developmental period corresponding to human kidney maturation were associated with a risk to the developing kidney (persistent increased organ weight, renal mineralization, and renal pelvic and tubular dilatations). Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness of STEGLUJAN in pediatric patients under 18 years of age have not been established. 8.5 Geriatric Use STEGLUJAN No dosage adjustment of STEGLUJAN is recommended based on age. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Because renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating ertugliflozin, and sitagliptin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Ertugliflozin In ertugliflozin clinical trials, a total of 876 (25.7%) patients treated with ertugliflozin were 65 years and older, and 152 (4.5%) patients treated with ertugliflozin were 75 years and older. Patients 65 years and older had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to volume depletion compared to younger patients; events were reported in 1.1%, 2.2%, and 2.6% of patients treated with comparator, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In VERTIS CV, a total of 2780 (50.5%) patients treated with ertugliflozin were 65 years and older, and 595 (10.8%) patients treated with ertugliflozin were 75 years and older. Safety and efficacy were generally similar for patients age 65 years and older compared to patients younger than 65. Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3,884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. 8.6 Renal Impairment A 26-week placebo-controlled study of 313 patients with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease (eGFR \u226530 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ) treated with ertugliflozin did not demonstrate improvement in glycemic control. In the VERTIS CV study, there were 1370 patients (25%) with an eGFR \u226590 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 2929 patients (53%) with an eGFR of \u226560 to less than 90 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , 879 patients (16%) with an eGFR of \u226545 to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 and 299 patients (5%) with eGFR of 30 to <45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 treated with ertugliflozin. Similar effects on glycemic control at Week 18 were observed in patients treated with ertugliflozin in each eGFR subgroup and also in the overall patient population. STEGLUJAN is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (eGFR less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), ESRD, or on dialysis [see Contraindications (4) ] . No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with eGFR \u226545 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment No dosage adjustment of STEGLUJAN is necessary in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. STEGLUJAN has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended for use in this patient population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

In rats and rabbits, sitagliptin doses of 250 and 125 mg/kg, respectively (approximately 30 and 20 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose) did not adversely affect development outcomes of either species. The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a HbA1c >7 and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with HbA1c >10. The estimated background risk of miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use STEGLUJAN No dosage adjustment of STEGLUJAN is recommended based on age. Elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function. Because renal function abnormalities can occur after initiating ertugliflozin, and sitagliptin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) and Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Ertugliflozin In ertugliflozin clinical trials, a total of 876 (25.7%) patients treated with ertugliflozin were 65 years and older, and 152 (4.5%) patients treated with ertugliflozin were 75 years and older. Patients 65 years and older had a higher incidence of adverse reactions related to volume depletion compared to younger patients; events were reported in 1.1%, 2.2%, and 2.6% of patients treated with comparator, ertugliflozin 5 mg, and ertugliflozin 15 mg, respectively [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . In VERTIS CV, a total of 2780 (50.5%) patients treated with ertugliflozin were 65 years and older, and 595 (10.8%) patients treated with ertugliflozin were 75 years and older. Safety and efficacy were generally similar for patients age 65 years and older compared to patients younger than 65. Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3,884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out."

Employ the usual supportive measures as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Ertugliflozin Removal of ertugliflozin by hemodialysis has not been studied. Sitagliptin In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as dictated by the patient's clinical status. Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action STEGLUJAN STEGLUJAN combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: ertugliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, and sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor. Ertugliflozin SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ertugliflozin Urinary Glucose Excretion and Urinary Volume Dose-dependent increases in the amount of glucose excreted in urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single- and multiple-dose administration of ertugliflozin. Dose-response modeling indicates that ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg result in near maximal urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Enhanced UGE is maintained after multiple-dose administration. UGE with ertugliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of ertugliflozin on QTc interval was evaluated in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled 3-period crossover study in 42 healthy subjects. At 6.7 times the therapeutic exposures with maximum recommended dose, ertugliflozin does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. Sitagliptin General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Introduction Ertugliflozin The pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The steady state mean plasma AUC and C max were 398 ng\u2219hr/mL and 81.3 ng/mL, respectively, with 5 mg ertugliflozin once daily treatment, and 1,193 ng\u2219hr/mL and 268 ng/mL, respectively, with 15 mg ertugliflozin once daily treatment. Steady-state is reached after 4 to 6 days of once-daily dosing with ertugliflozin. Ertugliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in plasma up to 10-40% following multiple dosing. Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. After oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose proportional manner. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2219hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased approximately 14% following 100-mg doses at steady state compared to the first dose. The intra subject and inter subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption STEGLUJAN The effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin when administered as STEGLUJAN tablets are comparable to those reported for the individual tablets. Administration of STEGLUJAN with food decreased ertugliflozin C max by 29% and had no meaningful effect on ertugliflozin AUC inf , and on sitagliptin AUC inf and C max . Ertugliflozin Following single-dose oral administration of 5 mg and 15 mg of ertugliflozin, peak plasma concentrations of ertugliflozin occur at 1 hour postdose (median T max ) under fasted conditions. Plasma C max and AUC of ertugliflozin increase in a dose-proportional manner following single doses from 0.5 mg (0.1 times the lowest recommended dose) to 300 mg (20 times the highest recommended dose) and following multiple doses from 1 mg (0.2 times the lowest recommended dose) to 100 mg (6.7 times the highest recommended dose). The absolute oral bioavailability of ertugliflozin following administration of a 15 mg dose is approximately 100%. Effect of Food Administration of ertugliflozin with a high-fat and high-calorie meal decreases ertugliflozin C max by 29% and prolongs T max by 1 hour, but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. The observed effect of food on ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics is not considered clinically relevant, and ertugliflozin may be administered with or without food. In Phase 3 clinical trials, ertugliflozin was administered without regard to meals. Sitagliptin The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Because coadministration of a high fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics, sitagliptin may be administered with or without food. Distribution Ertugliflozin The mean steady-state volume of distribution of ertugliflozin following an intravenous dose is 85.5 L. Plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin is 93.6% and is independent of ertugliflozin plasma concentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of ertugliflozin is 0.66. Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 L. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Metabolism Ertugliflozin Metabolism is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. The major metabolic pathway for ertugliflozin is UGT1A9 and UGT2B7-mediated O-glucuronidation to two glucuronides that are pharmacologically inactive at clinically relevant concentrations. CYP-mediated (oxidative) metabolism of ertugliflozin is minimal (12%). Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Ertugliflozin The mean systemic plasma clearance following an intravenous 100 \u00b5g dose was 11.2 L/hr. The mean elimination half-life in type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function was estimated to be 16.6 hours based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]-ertugliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 40.9% and 50.2% of the drug-related radioactivity was eliminated in feces and urine, respectively. Only 1.5% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged ertugliflozin in urine and 33.8% as unchanged ertugliflozin in feces, which is likely due to biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites and subsequent hydrolysis to parent. Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment STEGLUJAN Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin after administration of STEGLUJAN in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Ertugliflozin In a clinical pharmacology study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (as determined by eGFR), following a single-dose administration of 15 mg ertugliflozin, the mean increases in AUC of ertugliflozin were 1.6-, 1.7-, and 1.6-fold, respectively, for mild, moderate and severe renally-impaired patients, compared to subjects with normal renal function. These increases in ertugliflozin AUC are not considered clinically meaningful. The 24-hour urinary glucose excretion declined with increasing severity of renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with renal impairment. Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ertugliflozin Moderate hepatic impairment (based on the Child-Pugh classification) did not result in an increase in exposure of ertugliflozin. The AUC of ertugliflozin decreased by approximately 13%, and C max decreased by approximately 21% compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. This decrease in ertugliflozin exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment. The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment for sitagliptin is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Effects of Age, Body Weight/ Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Ertugliflozin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin. Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies STEGLUJAN Coadministration of single dose of ertugliflozin (15 mg) and sitagliptin (100 mg) did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either ertugliflozin or metformin in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with STEGLUJAN have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin, the individual components of STEGLUJAN. Ertugliflozin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit CYP450 isoenzymes (CYPs) 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2B6, 2D6, or 3A4, and did not induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Ertugliflozin was not a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro . Ertugliflozin did not inhibit UGT1A6, 1A9, or 2B7 in vitro and was a weak inhibitor (IC 50 >39 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 and 1A4. Ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit UGT1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, or 2B7 in vitro . Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs eliminated by these enzymes. Ertugliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters and is not a substrate of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation transporters (OCT1, OCT2), or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3). Ertugliflozin or ertugliflozin glucuronides do not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 transporters, or transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, at clinically relevant concentrations. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are substrates of these transporters. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions No dose adjustment of STEGLUJAN is recommended when coadministered with commonly prescribed medicinal products. Ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without coadministration of metformin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, and simvastatin in healthy subjects (see Figure 1 ). Coadministration of ertugliflozin with multiple doses of 600 mg once daily rifampin (an inducer of UGT and CYP enzymes) resulted in approximately 39% and 15% mean reductions in ertugliflozin AUC and C max , respectively, relative to ertugliflozin administered alone. These changes in exposure are not considered clinically relevant. Ertugliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, and simvastatin when coadministered in healthy subjects (see Figure 2 ). Physiologically-based PK (PBPK) modeling suggests that coadministration of mefenamic acid (UGT inhibitor) may increase the AUC and C max of ertugliflozin by 1.51- and 1.19-fold, respectively. These predicted changes in exposure are not considered clinically relevant. Figure 1: Effects of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Ertugliflozin Figure 2: Effects of Ertugliflozin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a p-glycoprotein substrate, but does not inhibit p-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action STEGLUJAN STEGLUJAN combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: ertugliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, and sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor. Ertugliflozin SGLT2 is the predominant transporter responsible for reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the circulation. Ertugliflozin is an inhibitor of SGLT2. By inhibiting SGLT2, ertugliflozin reduces renal reabsorption of filtered glucose and lowers the renal threshold for glucose, and thereby increases urinary glucose excretion. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Ertugliflozin Urinary Glucose Excretion and Urinary Volume Dose-dependent increases in the amount of glucose excreted in urine were observed in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus following single- and multiple-dose administration of ertugliflozin. Dose-response modeling indicates that ertugliflozin 5 mg and 15 mg result in near maximal urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Enhanced UGE is maintained after multiple-dose administration. UGE with ertugliflozin also results in increases in urinary volume. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of ertugliflozin on QTc interval was evaluated in a Phase 1 randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled 3-period crossover study in 42 healthy subjects. At 6.7 times the therapeutic exposures with maximum recommended dose, ertugliflozin does not prolong QTc to any clinically relevant extent. Sitagliptin General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics General Introduction Ertugliflozin The pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin are similar in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The steady state mean plasma AUC and C max were 398 ng\u2219hr/mL and 81.3 ng/mL, respectively, with 5 mg ertugliflozin once daily treatment, and 1,193 ng\u2219hr/mL and 268 ng/mL, respectively, with 15 mg ertugliflozin once daily treatment. Steady-state is reached after 4 to 6 days of once-daily dosing with ertugliflozin. Ertugliflozin does not exhibit time-dependent pharmacokinetics and accumulates in plasma up to 10-40% following multiple dosing. Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. After oral administration of a 100-mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose proportional manner. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2219hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased approximately 14% following 100-mg doses at steady state compared to the first dose. The intra subject and inter subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption STEGLUJAN The effects of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin when administered as STEGLUJAN tablets are comparable to those reported for the individual tablets. Administration of STEGLUJAN with food decreased ertugliflozin C max by 29% and had no meaningful effect on ertugliflozin AUC inf , and on sitagliptin AUC inf and C max . Ertugliflozin Following single-dose oral administration of 5 mg and 15 mg of ertugliflozin, peak plasma concentrations of ertugliflozin occur at 1 hour postdose (median T max ) under fasted conditions. Plasma C max and AUC of ertugliflozin increase in a dose-proportional manner following single doses from 0.5 mg (0.1 times the lowest recommended dose) to 300 mg (20 times the highest recommended dose) and following multiple doses from 1 mg (0.2 times the lowest recommended dose) to 100 mg (6.7 times the highest recommended dose). The absolute oral bioavailability of ertugliflozin following administration of a 15 mg dose is approximately 100%. Effect of Food Administration of ertugliflozin with a high-fat and high-calorie meal decreases ertugliflozin C max by 29% and prolongs T max by 1 hour, but does not alter AUC as compared with the fasted state. The observed effect of food on ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics is not considered clinically relevant, and ertugliflozin may be administered with or without food. In Phase 3 clinical trials, ertugliflozin was administered without regard to meals. Sitagliptin The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Because coadministration of a high fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics, sitagliptin may be administered with or without food. Distribution Ertugliflozin The mean steady-state volume of distribution of ertugliflozin following an intravenous dose is 85.5 L. Plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin is 93.6% and is independent of ertugliflozin plasma concentrations. Plasma protein binding is not meaningfully altered in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of ertugliflozin is 0.66. Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 L. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Metabolism Ertugliflozin Metabolism is the primary clearance mechanism for ertugliflozin. The major metabolic pathway for ertugliflozin is UGT1A9 and UGT2B7-mediated O-glucuronidation to two glucuronides that are pharmacologically inactive at clinically relevant concentrations. CYP-mediated (oxidative) metabolism of ertugliflozin is minimal (12%). Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Ertugliflozin The mean systemic plasma clearance following an intravenous 100 \u00b5g dose was 11.2 L/hr. The mean elimination half-life in type 2 diabetic patients with normal renal function was estimated to be 16.6 hours based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis. Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]-ertugliflozin solution to healthy subjects, approximately 40.9% and 50.2% of the drug-related radioactivity was eliminated in feces and urine, respectively. Only 1.5% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged ertugliflozin in urine and 33.8% as unchanged ertugliflozin in feces, which is likely due to biliary excretion of glucuronide metabolites and subsequent hydrolysis to parent. Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100-mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein, which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a p-glycoprotein inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment STEGLUJAN Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin and sitagliptin after administration of STEGLUJAN in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Ertugliflozin In a clinical pharmacology study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment (as determined by eGFR), following a single-dose administration of 15 mg ertugliflozin, the mean increases in AUC of ertugliflozin were 1.6-, 1.7-, and 1.6-fold, respectively, for mild, moderate and severe renally-impaired patients, compared to subjects with normal renal function. These increases in ertugliflozin AUC are not considered clinically meaningful. The 24-hour urinary glucose excretion declined with increasing severity of renal impairment [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with renal impairment. Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment Ertugliflozin Moderate hepatic impairment (based on the Child-Pugh classification) did not result in an increase in exposure of ertugliflozin. The AUC of ertugliflozin decreased by approximately 13%, and C max decreased by approximately 21% compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. This decrease in ertugliflozin exposure is not considered clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with Child-Pugh class C (severe) hepatic impairment. The plasma protein binding of ertugliflozin was unaffected in patients with moderate hepatic impairment [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. No dosage adjustment for sitagliptin is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic insufficiency. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Effects of Age, Body Weight/ Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Ertugliflozin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, age, body weight, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of ertugliflozin. Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies STEGLUJAN Coadministration of single dose of ertugliflozin (15 mg) and sitagliptin (100 mg) did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either ertugliflozin or metformin in healthy subjects. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with STEGLUJAN have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with ertugliflozin and sitagliptin, the individual components of STEGLUJAN. Ertugliflozin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions In in vitro studies, ertugliflozin and ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit CYP450 isoenzymes (CYPs) 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2B6, 2D6, or 3A4, and did not induce CYPs 1A2, 2B6, or 3A4. Ertugliflozin was not a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A in vitro . Ertugliflozin did not inhibit UGT1A6, 1A9, or 2B7 in vitro and was a weak inhibitor (IC 50 >39 \u00b5M) of UGT1A1 and 1A4. Ertugliflozin glucuronides did not inhibit UGT1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9, or 2B7 in vitro . Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs eliminated by these enzymes. Ertugliflozin is a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) transporters and is not a substrate of organic anion transporters (OAT1, OAT3), organic cation transporters (OCT1, OCT2), or organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATP1B1, OATP1B3). Ertugliflozin or ertugliflozin glucuronides do not meaningfully inhibit P-gp, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3 transporters, or transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, at clinically relevant concentrations. Overall, ertugliflozin is unlikely to affect the pharmacokinetics of concurrently administered medications that are substrates of these transporters. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions No dose adjustment of STEGLUJAN is recommended when coadministered with commonly prescribed medicinal products. Ertugliflozin pharmacokinetics were similar with and without coadministration of metformin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, and simvastatin in healthy subjects (see Figure 1 ). Coadministration of ertugliflozin with multiple doses of 600 mg once daily rifampin (an inducer of UGT and CYP enzymes) resulted in approximately 39% and 15% mean reductions in ertugliflozin AUC and C max , respectively, relative to ertugliflozin administered alone. These changes in exposure are not considered clinically relevant. Ertugliflozin had no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glimepiride, sitagliptin, and simvastatin when coadministered in healthy subjects (see Figure 2 ). Physiologically-based PK (PBPK) modeling suggests that coadministration of mefenamic acid (UGT inhibitor) may increase the AUC and C max of ertugliflozin by 1.51- and 1.19-fold, respectively. These predicted changes in exposure are not considered clinically relevant. Figure 1: Effects of Other Drugs on the Pharmacokinetics of Ertugliflozin Figure 2: Effects of Ertugliflozin on the Pharmacokinetics of Other Drugs Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a p-glycoprotein substrate, but does not inhibit p-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Ertugliflozin Carcinogenicity was evaluated in CD-1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. In the mouse study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses of 5, 15, and 40 mg/kg/day for up to 97 weeks in males and 102 weeks in females. There were no ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (approximately 50 times human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose [MRHD] of 15 mg/day based on AUC). In the rat study, ertugliflozin was administered by oral gavage at doses of 1.5, 5, and 15 mg/kg/day for up to 92 weeks in females and 104 weeks in males. Ertugliflozin-related neoplastic findings included an increased incidence of adrenal medullary pheochromocytoma (PCC) in male rats at 15 mg/kg/day. Although the molecular mechanism remains unknown, this finding may be related to carbohydrate malabsorption leading to altered calcium homeostasis, which has been associated with PCC development in rats and has unclear relevance to human risk. The no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for neoplasia was 5 mg/kg/day (approximately 16 times human exposure at the MRHD of 15 mg/day, based on AUC). Sitagliptin A two year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Ertugliflozin Ertugliflozin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the microbial reverse mutation, in vitro cytogenetic (human lymphocytes), and in vivo rat micronucleus assays. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. Impairment of Fertility Ertugliflozin In the rat fertility and embryonic development study, male and female rats were administered ertugliflozin at 5, 25, and 250 mg/kg/day. No effects on fertility were observed at 250 mg/kg/day (approximately 480 and 570 times male and female human exposures, respectively, at the MRHD of 15 mg/day based on AUC comparison). Sitagliptin In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1,000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Glycemic Control Trials in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus The efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin have been studied in 3 multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active comparator-controlled, clinical studies involving 1,985 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. These studies included White, Hispanic or Latino, Black or African American, Asian, and other racial and ethnic groups, and patients with an age range of 21 to 85 years. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, treatment with ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin reduced HbA1c compared to placebo or active comparator. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with ertugliflozin in combination with sitagliptin, the change in HbA1c was generally similar across subgroups defined by age, sex, and race. In Combination with Sitagliptin versus Ertugliflozin Alone and Sitagliptin Alone, as Add-on to Metformin HCl A total of 1,233 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with inadequate glycemic control (HbA1c between 7.5% and 11%) on metformin HCl monotherapy (\u22651,500 mg/day for \u22658 weeks) participated in a randomized, double-blind, 26-week, active controlled study (NCT02099110) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg administered orally in combination with sitagliptin 100 mg compared to the individual components. Patients were randomized to one of five treatment arms: ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, sitagliptin 100 mg, ertugliflozin 5 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg, or ertugliflozin 15 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg. At Week 26, ertugliflozin 5 mg or 15 mg + sitagliptin 100 mg provided statistically significantly greater reductions in HbA1c compared to the individual components. More patients achieved an HbA1c < 7% on the combination as compared to the individual components (see Table 6 and Figure 3 ). Table 6: Results at Week 26 from a Factorial Study with Ertugliflozin and Sitagliptin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin HCl Compared to Individual Components Alone N includes all randomized and treated patients with a baseline measurement of the outcome variable. At Week 26 the primary HbA1c endpoint was missing for 13%, 10%, 11%, 11%, and 12% of patients and during the trial rescue medication was initiated by 6%, 6%, 3%, 2%, and 0% of patients randomized to sitagliptin, ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, ertugliflozin 5 mg + sitagliptin, and ertugliflozin 15 mg + sitagliptin, respectively. Missing Week 26 measurements were imputed using multiple imputation with a mean equal to the baseline value of the patient. Results included measurements collected after initiation of rescue medication. For those subjects who did not receive rescue medication and had values measured at 26 weeks, the mean change from baseline for HbA1c was -1.1%, -1.1%, -1.1%, -1.5% and -1.6% for sitagliptin, ertugliflozin 5 mg, ertugliflozin 15 mg, ertugliflozin 5 mg + sitagliptin, and ertugliflozin 15 mg + sitagliptin, respectively.

Figure 3 14.2 Ertugliflozin Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Established Cardiovascular Disease The effect of ertugliflozin on cardiovascular risk in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease was evaluated in the VERTIS CV study (NCT01986881), a multicenter, multi-national, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event driven trial. The study compared the risk of experiencing a major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) between ertugliflozin and placebo when these were added to and used concomitantly with standard of care treatments for diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. A total of 8,246 patients were randomized to placebo (N=2,747), oral once daily ertugliflozin 5 mg (N=2,752), or oral once daily ertugliflozin 15 mg (N=2,747) and followed for a median of 3 years. Approximately 88% of the study population was White, 6% Asian, and 3% Black or African American. The mean age was 64 years and approximately 70% were male. All patients in the study had inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus at baseline (HbA1c greater than or equal to 7%). The mean duration of type 2 diabetes mellitus was 13 years, the mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.2% and the mean eGFR was 76 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . At baseline, patients were treated with one (32%) or more (67%) antidiabetic medications including biguanides (metformin HCl) (76%), insulin (47%), sulfonylureas (41%), DPP-4 inhibitors (11%) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (3%). Almost all patients (99%) had established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at baseline including: a documented history of coronary artery disease (76%), cerebrovascular disease (23%) or peripheral artery disease (19%). Approximately 24% patients had a history of heart failure (HF). At baseline, the mean systolic blood pressure was 133 mmHg, the mean diastolic blood pressure was 77 mmHg, the mean LDL was 89 mg/dL, and the mean HDL was 44 mg/dL. At baseline, approximately 81% of patients were treated with renin angiotensin system inhibitors, 69% with beta-blockers, 43% with diuretics, 82% with statins, 4% with ezetimibe, and 89% with antiplatelet agents. The primary endpoint in VERTIS CV was the time to first occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). A major adverse cardiovascular event was defined as occurrence of either a cardiovascular death or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal stroke. The statistical analysis plan pre-specified that the 5 and 15 mg doses would be combined for the analysis. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE. Type I error was controlled across multiple tests using a hierarchical testing strategy. The incidence rate of MACE was similar between the ertugliflozin-treated and placebo-treated patients. The estimated hazard ratio of MACE associated with ertugliflozin relative to placebo was 0.97 with 95.6% confidence interval (0.85, 1.11). The upper bound of this confidence interval excluded a risk larger than 1.3. ( Table 9 ). Results for the 5 mg and 15 mg doses were consistent with results for the combined dose group. Table 9: Analysis of MACE and its Components from the VERTIS-CV Study Intent-to-treat analysis set. Endpoint MACE was evaluated in subjects who took at least one dose of study medication and, for subjects who discontinued study medication prior to the end of the study, censored events that occurred more than 365 days after the last dose of study medication. Other endpoints were evaluated using all randomized subjects and events that occurred any time after the first dose of study medication until the last contact date. The total number of first events was analyzed for each endpoint.

      "WARNING: LACTIC ACIDOSIS Postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis have resulted in death, hypothermia, hypotension, and resistant bradyarrhythmias. The onset of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is often subtle, accompanied only by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, respiratory distress, somnolence, and abdominal pain. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate levels (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio, and metformin plasma levels generally >5 mcg/mL [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis include renal impairment, concomitant use of certain drugs (e.g., carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as topiramate), age 65 years old or greater, having a radiological study with contrast, surgery and other procedures, hypoxic states (e.g., acute congestive heart failure), excessive alcohol intake, and hepatic impairment. Steps to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis in these high risk groups are provided in the full prescribing information [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) , Drug Interactions (7) , and Use in Specific Populations (8.6 , 8.7 )] . If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, immediately discontinue JANUMET and institute general supportive measures in a hospital setting.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Take JANUMET orally twice daily with meals. ( 2.1 ) Individualize the dosage of JANUMET on the basis of the patient\u2019s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. ( 2.1 ) The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2000 mg of metformin HCl. ( 2.1 ) The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. ( 2.1 ) The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl twice daily. ( 2.1 ) Prior to initiation, assess renal function with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ( 2.2 ) Do not use in patients with eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET is not recommended in patients with eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . JANUMET may need to be discontinued at time of, or prior to, iodinated contrast imaging procedures. ( 2.3 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosing Take JANUMET orally twice daily with meals. Individualize the dosage of JANUMET on the basis of the patient\u2019s current regimen, effectiveness, and tolerability. The maximum recommended daily dose is 100 mg of sitagliptin and 2000 mg of metformin hydrochloride (HCl). Do not split or divide JANUMET tablets. The recommended starting dose in patients not currently treated with metformin is 50 mg sitagliptin and 500 mg metformin HCl twice daily, with gradual dose escalation recommended to reduce gastrointestinal side effects associated with metformin. The starting dose in patients already treated with metformin should provide sitagliptin dosed as 50 mg twice daily (100 mg total daily dose) and the dose of metformin already being taken. For patients taking metformin HCl 850 mg twice daily, the recommended starting dose of JANUMET is 50 mg sitagliptin and 1000 mg metformin HCl twice daily. 2.2 Recommendations for Use in Renal Impairment Assess renal function prior to initiation of JANUMET and periodically thereafter. JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination JANUMET product. 2.3 Discontinuation for Iodinated Contrast Imaging Procedures Discontinue JANUMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of liver disease, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis: See boxed warning . ( 5.1 ) Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUMET. ( 5.2 ) Heart Failure : Has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUMET in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiating JANUMET and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function. ( 5.4 ) Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.5 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUMET, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.7 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.8 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUMET. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of JANUMET. In JANUMET-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue JANUMET and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] : Before initiating JANUMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) ]. JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination JANUMET product. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking JANUMET. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of JANUMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop JANUMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart JANUMET if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. JANUMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue JANUMET. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of JANUMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUMET. After initiation of JANUMET, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUMET should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUMET. 5.3 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUMET prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUMET. 5.4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiation of therapy with JANUMET and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, particularly in elderly patients, renal function should be assessed more frequently and JANUMET discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.5 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on JANUMET and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues JANUMET may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JANUMET [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, one of the components of JANUMET. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUMET, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUMET. 5.8 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.9 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUMET. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUMET should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Rosiglitazone In a placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and rosiglitazone (sitagliptin, N=181; placebo, N=97), the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality through Week 18 in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 5.5%; placebo, 5.2%) and nasopharyngitis (6.1%, 4.1%). Through Week 54, the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Insulin In a 24-week placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and insulin (sitagliptin, N=229; placebo, N=233), the only adverse reaction reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo was hypoglycemia (Table 3). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=5), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required although most (77%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than that observed with placebo and metformin coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required: Intent-to-treat population. (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies of Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin Coadministered with Glimepiride or Insulin Add-On to Glimepiride + Metformin (24 weeks) Sitagliptin 100 mg + Metformin + Glimepiride Placebo + Metformin + Glimepiride N = 116 N = 113 Overall (%) 19 (16.4) 1 (0.9) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.82 0.02 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin + Metformin (24 weeks) Sitagliptin 100 mg + Metformin + Insulin Placebo + Metformin + Insulin N = 229 N = 233 Overall (%) 35 (15.3) 19 (8.2) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 0.98 0.61 Severe (%) 1 (0.4) 1 (0.4) The overall incidence of reported adverse reactions of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given sitagliptin alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given sitagliptin in combination with metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin alone, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.3% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 2.1% in patients given add-on placebo. In the study of sitagliptin and add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms With the combination of sitagliptin and metformin, no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed. Pancreatitis In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Sitagliptin The most common adverse experience in sitagliptin monotherapy reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo was nasopharyngitis. Metformin The most common (>5%) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. Laboratory Tests Sitagliptin The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%). In most but not all studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to a small increase in neutrophils. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant. Metformin In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUMET, sitagliptin, or metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome ; upper respiratory tract infection; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ]; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis) and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia; bullous pemphigoid; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury; rhabdomyolysis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 presents clinically significant drug interactions with JANUMET: Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with JANUMET Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with JANUMET may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Intervention: Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. Examples: Topiramate, zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide. Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT 2 ] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with JANUMET. Examples: Ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine. Alcohol Clinical Impact: Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Intervention: Warn patients against alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET. Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Clinical Impact: Coadministration of JANUMET with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Intervention: Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin. Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. Intervention: When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving JANUMET, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving JANUMET, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia. Examples: Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring. ( 7 ) Drugs that reduce metformin clearance (such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) may increase the accumulation of metformin. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. ( 7 ) Alcohol can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Use: Assess renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUMET in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data ] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 6-times, respectively, a 2000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20% respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from post-marketing studies do not report a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups. Animal Data Sitagliptin and Metformin No animal reproduction studies were conducted with the coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin. Sitagliptin In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. Metformin Metformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUMET in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data ] . There are no reports of adverse effects on breastfed infants exposed to metformin. There is no information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUMET and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUMET or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. Metformin Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUMET have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use JANUMET In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. [See Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment JANUMET JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed dose combination JANUMET product. JANUMET is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Metformin Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. JANUMET is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]"

      "8.5 Geriatric Use JANUMET In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. [See Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose with JANUMET, contact the Poison Control Center. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as indicated by the patient's clinical status. Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis. Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET JANUMET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2219hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin HCl tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 5), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET JANUMET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."
    ],
    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2219hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin HCl tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 5), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

The following data are based on the findings in studies with sitagliptin and metformin individually. Sitagliptin A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total), and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Metformin Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test ( S. typhimurium ), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. None of the clinical efficacy studies described below was conducted with JANUMET; however, bioequivalence of JANUMET with coadministered sitagliptin and metformin HCl tablets was demonstrated. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise A total of 1091 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin and metformin coadministration. Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive placebo, 100 mg of sitagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Sitagliptin and metformin coadministration provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to sitagliptin alone (Table 9, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy should be individualized and are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Sitagliptin Add-on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Alone A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 10). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) of Sitagliptin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and glimepiride had significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and glimepiride (Table 11), with mean reductions from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.9% and in FPG of -21 mg/dL. Rescue therapy was used in 8% of patients treated with add-on sitagliptin 100 mg and 29% of patients treated with add-on placebo. The patients treated with add-on sitagliptin had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. add-on placebo (+0.4 kg vs. -0.7 kg). In addition, add-on sitagliptin resulted in an increased rate of hypoglycemia compared to add-on placebo.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with sitagliptin and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between sitagliptin and placebo in body weight change.

Approximately 75% of patients were also taking metformin. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin (N=229) or placebo (N=233), administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. Among patients also receiving metformin, the median daily insulin (pre-mixed, intermediate or long acting) dose at baseline was 40 units in the sitagliptin-treated patients and 42 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin had significant improvements in A1C, FPG and 2-hour PPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin (Table 13). The adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight was -0.3 kg in patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin and -0.2 kg in patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with sitagliptin.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and sitagliptin (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to sitagliptin (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue sitagliptin or to discontinue sitagliptin and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 14). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, sitagliptin and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 15). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of sitagliptin to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C less than 8% and over 90% had A1C less than 9%). Table 15: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing Sitagliptin to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs. +1.1 kg).

      "Medication Guide JANUMET \u00ae (JAN-you-met) (sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride) tablets, for oral use This Medication Guide has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 07/2022 Read this Medication Guide carefully before you start taking JANUMET and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking with your doctor about your medical condition or your treatment. If you have any questions about JANUMET, ask your doctor or pharmacist. What is the most important information I should know about JANUMET? JANUMET can cause serious side effects , including: 1. Lactic Acidosis. Metformin, one of the medicines in JANUMET, can cause a rare but serious condition called lactic acidosis (a buildup of an acid in the blood) that can cause death. Lactic acidosis is a medical emergency and must be treated in the hospital. Stop taking JANUMET and call your doctor right away if you have any of the following symptoms, which could be signs of lactic acidosis: you feel cold in your hands or feet you feel dizzy or lightheaded you have a slow or irregular heartbeat you feel very weak or tired you have unusual (not normal) muscle pain you have trouble breathing you feel sleepy or drowsy you have stomach pains, nausea or vomiting Most people who have had lactic acidosis with metformin have other things that, combined with the metformin, led to the lactic acidosis. Tell your doctor if you have any of the following, because you have a higher chance for getting lactic acidosis with JANUMET if you: have severe kidney problems or your kidneys are affected by certain x-ray tests that use injectable dye have liver problems drink alcohol very often, or drink a lot of alcohol in short-term \"binge\" drinking get dehydrated (lose a large amount of body fluids). This can happen if you are sick with a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Lactic Acidosis: See boxed warning . ( 5.1 ) Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUMET. ( 5.2 ) Heart Failure : Has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUMET in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.3 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiating JANUMET and at least annually thereafter, assess renal function. ( 5.4 ) Vitamin B 12 Deficiency: Metformin may lower vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters annually and vitamin B 12 at 2 to 3 year intervals and manage any abnormalities. ( 5.5 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.6 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUMET, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.7 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.8 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUMET. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Lactic Acidosis There have been postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis, including fatal cases. These cases had a subtle onset and were accompanied by nonspecific symptoms such as malaise, myalgias, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, or increased somnolence; however, hypothermia, hypotension and resistant bradyarrhythmias have occurred with severe acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis was characterized by elevated blood lactate concentrations (>5 mmol/Liter), anion gap acidosis (without evidence of ketonuria or ketonemia), and an increased lactate/pyruvate ratio; metformin plasma levels were generally >5 mcg/mL. Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate increasing lactate blood levels which may increase the risk of lactic acidosis, especially in patients at risk. If metformin-associated lactic acidosis is suspected, general supportive measures should be instituted promptly in a hospital setting, along with immediate discontinuation of JANUMET. In JANUMET-treated patients with a diagnosis or strong suspicion of lactic acidosis, prompt hemodialysis is recommended to correct the acidosis and remove accumulated metformin (metformin HCl is dialyzable, with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions). Hemodialysis has often resulted in reversal of symptoms and recovery. Educate patients and their families about the symptoms of lactic acidosis and if these symptoms occur instruct them to discontinue JANUMET and report these symptoms to their health care provider. For each of the known and possible risk factors for metformin-associated lactic acidosis, recommendations to reduce the risk of and manage metformin-associated lactic acidosis are provided below: Renal Impairment The postmarketing metformin-associated lactic acidosis cases primarily occurred in patients with significant renal impairment. The risk of metformin accumulation and metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the severity of renal impairment because metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney. Clinical recommendations based upon the patient's renal function include [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] : Before initiating JANUMET, obtain an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [see Contraindications (4) ]. JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed combination JANUMET product. Obtain an eGFR at least annually in all patients taking JANUMET. In patients at increased risk for the development of renal impairment (e.g., the elderly), renal function should be assessed more frequently. Drug Interactions The concomitant use of JANUMET with specific drugs may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis: those that impair renal function, result in significant hemodynamic change, interfere with acid-base balance or increase metformin accumulation [see Drug Interactions (7) ] . Therefore, consider more frequent monitoring of patients. Age 65 or Greater The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis increases with the patient's age because elderly patients have a greater likelihood of having hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment than younger patients. Assess renal function more frequently in elderly patients [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Radiological Studies with Contrast Administration of intravascular iodinated contrast agents in metformin-treated patients has led to an acute decrease in renal function and the occurrence of lactic acidosis. Stop JANUMET at the time of, or prior to, an iodinated contrast imaging procedure in patients with an eGFR between 30 and 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ; in patients with a history of hepatic impairment, alcoholism, or heart failure; or in patients who will be administered intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Re-evaluate eGFR 48 hours after the imaging procedure, and restart JANUMET if renal function is stable. Surgery and Other Procedures Withholding of food and fluids during surgical or other procedures may increase the risk for volume depletion, hypotension and renal impairment. JANUMET should be temporarily discontinued while patients have restricted food and fluid intake. Hypoxic States Several of the postmarketing cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis occurred in the setting of acute congestive heart failure (particularly when accompanied by hypoperfusion and hypoxemia). Cardiovascular collapse (shock), acute myocardial infarction, sepsis, and other conditions associated with hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur, discontinue JANUMET. Excessive Alcohol Intake Alcohol potentiates the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism and this may increase the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET. Hepatic Impairment Patients with hepatic impairment have developed with cases of metformin-associated lactic acidosis. This may be due to impaired lactate clearance resulting in higher lactate blood levels. Therefore, avoid use of JANUMET in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. 5.2 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUMET. After initiation of JANUMET, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUMET should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUMET. 5.3 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUMET prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUMET. 5.4 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. Before initiation of therapy with JANUMET and at least annually thereafter, renal function should be assessed. In patients in whom development of renal dysfunction is anticipated, particularly in elderly patients, renal function should be assessed more frequently and JANUMET discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. JANUMET is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . 5.5 Vitamin B 12 Deficiency In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, may be associated with anemia but appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. Certain individuals (those with inadequate vitamin B 12 or calcium intake or absorption) appear to be predisposed to developing subnormal vitamin B 12 levels. Measure hematologic parameters on an annual basis and vitamin B 12 measurements at 2- to 3-year intervals in patients on JANUMET and manage any abnormalities [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. 5.6 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues JANUMET may increase the risk of hypoglycemia when combined with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) [see Adverse Reactions (6) ]. A lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with JANUMET [ see Drug Interactions (7) ]. 5.7 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with sitagliptin, one of the components of JANUMET. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with sitagliptin, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUMET, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUMET. 5.8 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.9 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUMET. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUMET should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

Through Week 54, the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (sitagliptin, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). Sitagliptin in Combination with Metformin and Insulin In a 24-week placebo-controlled study of sitagliptin 100 mg as add-on therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin and insulin (sitagliptin, N=229; placebo, N=233), the only adverse reaction reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with sitagliptin and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo was hypoglycemia (Table 3). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=5), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required although most (77%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When the combination of sitagliptin and metformin was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients reporting at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than that observed with placebo and metformin coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin (Table 3).

In patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin alone, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.3% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 2.1% in patients given add-on placebo. In the study of sitagliptin and add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on sitagliptin and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms With the combination of sitagliptin and metformin, no clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed. Pancreatitis In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Sitagliptin The most common adverse experience in sitagliptin monotherapy reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo was nasopharyngitis. Metformin The most common (>5%) established adverse reactions due to initiation of metformin therapy are diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, indigestion, asthenia, and headache. Laboratory Tests Sitagliptin The incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with sitagliptin and metformin (7.6%) compared to patients treated with placebo and metformin (8.7%). In most but not all studies, a small increase in white blood cell count (approximately 200 cells/microL difference in WBC vs placebo; mean baseline WBC approximately 6600 cells/microL) was observed due to a small increase in neutrophils. This change in laboratory parameters is not considered to be clinically relevant. Metformin In controlled clinical trials of metformin of 29 weeks duration, a decrease to subnormal levels of previously normal serum vitamin B 12 levels, without clinical manifestations, was observed in approximately 7% of patients. Such decrease, possibly due to interference with B 12 absorption from the B 12 -intrinsic factor complex, is, however, very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be rapidly reversible with discontinuation of metformin or vitamin B 12 supplementation. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUMET, sitagliptin, or metformin. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome ; upper respiratory tract infection; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ]; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis) and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia; bullous pemphigoid; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; cholestatic, hepatocellular, and mixed hepatocellular liver injury; rhabdomyolysis."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Table 4 presents clinically significant drug interactions with JANUMET: Table 4: Clinically Significant Drug Interactions with JANUMET Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors Clinical Impact: Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors frequently cause a decrease in serum bicarbonate and induce non-anion gap, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Concomitant use of these drugs with JANUMET may increase the risk for lactic acidosis. Intervention: Consider more frequent monitoring of these patients. Examples: Topiramate, zonisamide, acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide. Drugs that Reduce Metformin Clearance Clinical Impact: Concomitant use of drugs that interfere with common renal tubular transport systems involved in the renal elimination of metformin (e.g., organic cationic transporter-2 [OCT 2 ] / multidrug and toxin extrusion [MATE] inhibitors) could increase systemic exposure to metformin and may increase the risk for lactic acidosis [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Intervention: Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use with JANUMET. Examples: Ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine. Alcohol Clinical Impact: Alcohol is known to potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Intervention: Warn patients against alcohol intake while receiving JANUMET. Insulin Secretagogues or Insulin Clinical Impact: Coadministration of JANUMET with an insulin secretagogue (e.g., sulfonylurea) or insulin may increase the risk of hypoglycemia. Intervention: Patients receiving an insulin secretagogue or insulin may require lower doses of the insulin secretagogue or insulin. Drugs Affecting Glycemic Control Clinical Impact: Certain drugs tend to produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. Intervention: When such drugs are administered to a patient receiving JANUMET, observe the patient closely for loss of blood glucose control. When such drugs are withdrawn from a patient receiving JANUMET, observe the patient closely for hypoglycemia. Examples: Thiazides and other diuretics, corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blockers, and isoniazid. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors may increase risk of lactic acidosis. Consider more frequent monitoring. ( 7 ) Drugs that reduce metformin clearance (such as ranolazine, vandetanib, dolutegravir, and cimetidine) may increase the accumulation of metformin. Consider the benefits and risks of concomitant use. ( 7 ) Alcohol can potentiate the effect of metformin on lactate metabolism. Warn patients against excessive alcohol intake. ( 7 )"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: Advise premenopausal females of the potential for an unintended pregnancy. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Use: Assess renal function more frequently. ( 8.5 ) Hepatic Impairment: Avoid use in patients with hepatic impairment. ( 8.7 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUMET in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. Published studies with metformin use during pregnancy have not reported a clear association with metformin and major birth defect or miscarriage risk [see Data ] . There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC. No adverse developmental effects were observed when metformin was administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses up to 2- and 6-times, respectively, a 2000 mg clinical dose, based on body surface area [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20% respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Human Data Published data from post-marketing studies do not report a clear association with metformin and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes when metformin is used during pregnancy. However, these studies cannot definitely establish the absence of any risk because of methodological limitations, including small sample size and inconsistent comparator groups. Animal Data Sitagliptin and Metformin No animal reproduction studies were conducted with the coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin. Sitagliptin In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. Metformin Metformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUMET in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Limited published studies report that metformin is present in human milk [see Data ] . There are no reports of adverse effects on breastfed infants exposed to metformin. There is no information on the effects of metformin on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUMET and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUMET or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. Metformin Published clinical lactation studies report that metformin is present in human milk, which resulted in infant doses approximately 0.11% to 1% of the maternal weight-adjusted dosage and a milk/plasma ratio ranging between 0.13 and 1. However, the studies were not designed to definitely establish the risk of use of metformin during lactation because of small sample size and limited adverse event data collected in infants. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Discuss the potential for unintended pregnancy with premenopausal women as therapy with metformin may result in ovulation in some anovulatory women. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUMET have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use JANUMET In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. [See Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients. 8.6 Renal Impairment JANUMET JANUMET is not recommended in patients with an eGFR between 30 and less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 because these patients require a lower dosage of sitagliptin than what is available in the fixed dose combination JANUMET product. JANUMET is contraindicated in severe renal impairment, patients with an eGFR below 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Contraindications (4) , Warnings and Precautions (5.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Metformin Metformin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of metformin accumulation and lactic acidosis increases with the degree of renal impairment. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Use of metformin in patients with hepatic impairment has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis. JANUMET is not recommended in patients with hepatic impairment. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.1) .]"

Sitagliptin In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. Metformin Metformin did not cause adverse developmental effects when administered to pregnant Sprague Dawley rats and rabbits up to 600 mg/kg/day during the period of organogenesis. This represents an exposure of about 2- and 6-times a 2000 mg clinical dose based on body surface area (mg/m 2 ) for rats and rabbits, respectively."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUMET have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05)."

      "8.5 Geriatric Use JANUMET In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy and the higher risk of lactic acidosis. Renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients. [See Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1 , 5.4) ; Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] Sitagliptin Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in clinical studies of sitagliptin, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Metformin Controlled clinical studies of metformin did not include sufficient numbers of elderly patients to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, although other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and young patients."

      "10 OVERDOSAGE In the event of overdose with JANUMET, contact the Poison Control Center. In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ supportive measures, e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring (including obtaining an electrocardiogram), and institute supportive therapy as indicated by the patient's clinical status. Sitagliptin is modestly dialyzable. In clinical studies, approximately 13.5% of the dose was removed over a 3- to 4-hour hemodialysis session. Prolonged hemodialysis may be considered if clinically appropriate. It is not known if sitagliptin is dialyzable by peritoneal dialysis. Overdose of metformin has occurred, including ingestion of amounts greater than 50 grams. Hypoglycemia was reported in approximately 10% of cases, but no causal association with metformin has been established. Lactic acidosis has been reported in approximately 32% of metformin overdose cases [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Metformin is dialyzable with a clearance of up to 170 mL/min under good hemodynamic conditions. Therefore, hemodialysis may be useful for removal of accumulated drug from patients in whom metformin overdosage is suspected."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET JANUMET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2219hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin HCl tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 5), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action JANUMET JANUMET combines two antihyperglycemic agents with complementary mechanisms of action to improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, and metformin HCl, a member of the biguanide class. Sitagliptin Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. Metformin Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent which improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. With metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may decrease."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Sitagliptin In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear what these findings mean for changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800-mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline at 3 hours postdose was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800-mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Sitagliptin The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u00b5M\u2219hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption Sitagliptin After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Metformin The absolute bioavailability of a metformin HCl 500-mg tablet given under fasting conditions is approximately 50-60%. Studies using single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 500 mg to 1,500 mg, and 850 mg to 2,550 mg (approximately 1.3 times the maximum recommended daily dosage), indicate that there is a lack of dose proportionality with increasing doses, which is due to decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Effect of Food Food decreases the extent of and slightly delays the absorption of metformin, as shown by approximately a 40% lower mean peak plasma concentration (C max ), a 25% lower area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC), and a 35-minute prolongation of time to peak plasma concentration (T max ) following administration of a single 850-mg tablet of metformin HCl with food, compared to the same tablet strength administered fasting. The clinical relevance of these decreases is unknown. Distribution Sitagliptin The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Metformin The apparent volume of distribution (V/F) of metformin following single oral doses of metformin HCl tablets 850 mg averaged 654 \u00b1 358 L. Metformin is negligibly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, most likely as a function of time. At usual clinical doses and dosing schedules of metformin HCl tablets, steady-state plasma concentrations of metformin are reached within 24-48 hours and are generally <1 mcg/mL. Elimination Sitagliptin Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metformin Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half-life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution. Metabolism Sitagliptin Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Metformin Intravenous single-dose studies in normal subjects demonstrate that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not undergo hepatic metabolism (no metabolites have been identified in humans) nor biliary excretion. Excretion Sitagliptin Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of p-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Metformin Elimination of metformin occurs primarily via renal excretion. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater than creatinine clearance, which indicates that tubular secretion is the major route of metformin elimination. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in renally impaired patients have not been performed [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . Sitagliptin An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment including patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) .] Metformin In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and blood half-life of metformin is prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased [see Contraindications (4) ; Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Patients with Hepatic Impairment JANUMET Studies characterizing the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin and metformin after administration of JANUMET in patients with hepatic impairment have not been performed. Sitagliptin In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9) [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Metformin No pharmacokinetic studies of metformin have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Sitagliptin Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Metformin Limited data from controlled pharmacokinetic studies of metformin in healthy elderly subjects suggest that total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, the half-life is prolonged, and C max is increased, compared to healthy young subjects. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily accounted for by a change in renal function. Metformin pharmacokinetic parameters did not differ significantly between normal subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus when analyzed according to gender. Similarly, in controlled clinical studies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect of metformin was comparable in males and females. No studies of metformin pharmacokinetic parameters according to race have been performed. In controlled clinical studies of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the antihyperglycemic effect was comparable in Whites (n=249), Blacks (n=51), and Hispanics (n=24). Drug Interaction Studies JANUMET Coadministration of multiple doses of sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin HCl (1000 mg) given twice daily did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of either sitagliptin or metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. Pharmacokinetic drug interaction studies with JANUMET have not been performed; however, such studies have been conducted with the individual components of JANUMET (sitagliptin and metformin HCl). Sitagliptin In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraception (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 5), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

The following data are based on the findings in studies with sitagliptin and metformin individually. Sitagliptin A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total), and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison). Metformin Long-term carcinogenicity studies have been performed in rats (dosing duration of 104 weeks) and mice (dosing duration of 91 weeks) at doses up to and including 900 mg/kg/day and 1500 mg/kg/day, respectively. These doses are both approximately four times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons. No evidence of carcinogenicity with metformin was found in either male or female mice. Similarly, there was no tumorigenic potential observed with metformin in male rats. There was, however, an increased incidence of benign stromal uterine polyps in female rats treated with 900 mg/kg/day. There was no evidence of a mutagenic potential of metformin in the following in vitro tests: Ames test ( S. typhimurium ), gene mutation test (mouse lymphoma cells), or chromosomal aberrations test (human lymphocytes). Results in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test were also negative. Fertility of male or female rats was unaffected by metformin when administered at doses as high as 600 mg/kg/day, which is approximately three times the maximum recommended human daily dose based on body surface area comparisons."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin has been studied in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on diet and exercise and in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. None of the clinical efficacy studies described below was conducted with JANUMET; however, bioequivalence of JANUMET with coadministered sitagliptin and metformin HCl tablets was demonstrated. Sitagliptin and Metformin Coadministration in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Diet and Exercise A total of 1091 patients with type 2 diabetes and inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled factorial study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin and metformin coadministration. Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive placebo, 100 mg of sitagliptin once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Sitagliptin and metformin coadministration provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to sitagliptin alone (Table 9, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: sitagliptin 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy should be individualized and are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Sitagliptin Add-on Therapy in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Inadequately Controlled on Metformin Alone A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of sitagliptin in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 10). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups. Table 10: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) of Sitagliptin as Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to pioglitazone rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and glimepiride had significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and glimepiride (Table 11), with mean reductions from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.9% and in FPG of -21 mg/dL. Rescue therapy was used in 8% of patients treated with add-on sitagliptin 100 mg and 29% of patients treated with add-on placebo. The patients treated with add-on sitagliptin had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. add-on placebo (+0.4 kg vs. -0.7 kg). In addition, add-on sitagliptin resulted in an increased rate of hypoglycemia compared to add-on placebo.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, sitagliptin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with sitagliptin and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with sitagliptin 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between sitagliptin and placebo in body weight change.

Approximately 75% of patients were also taking metformin. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of sitagliptin (N=229) or placebo (N=233), administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. Among patients also receiving metformin, the median daily insulin (pre-mixed, intermediate or long acting) dose at baseline was 40 units in the sitagliptin-treated patients and 42 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. Patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin had significant improvements in A1C, FPG and 2-hour PPG compared to patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin (Table 13). The adjusted mean change from baseline in body weight was -0.3 kg in patients receiving sitagliptin with metformin and insulin and -0.2 kg in patients receiving placebo with metformin and insulin. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with sitagliptin.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and sitagliptin (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to sitagliptin (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue sitagliptin or to discontinue sitagliptin and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 14). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, sitagliptin and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 15). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of sitagliptin to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C less than 8% and over 90% had A1C less than 9%). Table 15: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing Sitagliptin to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the sitagliptin group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with sitagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs. +1.1 kg).

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation.

The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin (JANUVIA) 100 mg QD Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo.

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation. JANUVIA 100 mg Glipizide A1C (%) N = 576 N = 559 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline A1C value. ) -0.5 -0.6 FPG (mg/dL) N = 583 N = 568 Baseline (mean) 166 164 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -8 -8 Figure 2: Mean Change from Baseline for A1C (%) Over 52 Weeks in a Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Per Protocol Population) The per protocol population (mean baseline A1C of 7.5%) included patients without major protocol violations who had observations at baseline and at Week 52. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Pancreatitis: There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, promptly discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.1 ) Heart failure : Heart failure has been observed with two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. Consider risks and benefits of JANUVIA in patients who have known risk factors for heart failure. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms. ( 5.2 ) Acute Renal Failure: Has been reported postmarketing, sometimes requiring dialysis. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. ( 5.3 ) Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues: Increased risk of hypoglycemia when used in combination with insulin and/or an insulin secretagogue. Lower dose of insulin or insulin secretagogue may be required. ( 5.4 , 7.1 ) Hypersensitivity Reactions: There have been postmarketing reports of serious allergic and hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA such as anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Promptly stop JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes, institute appropriate monitoring and treatment. ( 5.5 , 6.2 ) Severe and Disabling Arthralgia: Has been reported in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Consider as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. ( 5.6 ) Bullous Pemphigoid: There have been postmarketing reports requiring hospitalization in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA. ( 5.7 ) 5.1 Pancreatitis There have been postmarketing reports of acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic or necrotizing pancreatitis, in patients taking JANUVIA. After initiation of JANUVIA, patients should be observed carefully for signs and symptoms of pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, JANUVIA should promptly be discontinued and appropriate management should be initiated. It is unknown whether patients with a history of pancreatitis are at increased risk for the development of pancreatitis while using JANUVIA. 5.2 Heart Failure An association between dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor treatment and heart failure has been observed in cardiovascular outcomes trials for two other members of the DPP-4 inhibitor class. These trials evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Consider the risks and benefits of JANUVIA prior to initiating treatment in patients at risk for heart failure, such as those with a prior history of heart failure and a history of renal impairment, and observe these patients for signs and symptoms of heart failure during therapy. Advise patients of the characteristic symptoms of heart failure and to immediately report such symptoms. If heart failure develops, evaluate and manage according to current standards of care and consider discontinuation of JANUVIA. 5.3 Acute Renal Failure There have been postmarketing reports of worsening renal function, including acute renal failure, sometimes requiring dialysis. A subset of these reports involved patients with renal impairment, some of whom were prescribed inappropriate doses of sitagliptin. A return to baseline levels of renal impairment has been observed with supportive treatment and discontinuation of potentially causative agents. Consideration can be given to cautiously reinitiating JANUVIA if another etiology is deemed likely to have precipitated the acute worsening of renal function. Assessment of renal function is recommended prior to initiating JANUVIA and periodically thereafter. A dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with moderate or severe renal impairment and in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. [See Dosage and Administration (2.2) ; Use in Specific Populations (8.6) .] 5.4 Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues When JANUVIA was used in combination with insulin or insulin secretagogues (e.g., sulfonylurea), medications known to cause hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypoglycemia was increased over that of placebo used in combination with a sulfonylurea or with insulin. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Therefore, a lower dose of sulfonylurea or insulin may be required to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia. [See Drug Interactions (7.1) .] 5.5 Hypersensitivity Reactions There have been postmarketing reports of serious hypersensitivity reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA. These reactions include anaphylaxis, angioedema, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Onset of these reactions occurred within the first 3 months after initiation of treatment with JANUVIA, with some reports occurring after the first dose. If a hypersensitivity reaction is suspected, discontinue JANUVIA, assess for other potential causes for the event, and institute alternative treatment for diabetes. [See Adverse Reactions (6.2) .] Angioedema has also been reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors. Use caution in a patient with a history of angioedema with another DPP-4 inhibitor because it is unknown whether such patients will be predisposed to angioedema with JANUVIA. 5.6 Severe and Disabling Arthralgia There have been postmarketing reports of severe and disabling arthralgia in patients taking DPP-4 inhibitors. The time to onset of symptoms following initiation of drug therapy varied from one day to years. Patients experienced relief of symptoms upon discontinuation of the medication. A subset of patients experienced a recurrence of symptoms when restarting the same drug or a different DPP-4 inhibitor. Consider DPP-4 inhibitors as a possible cause for severe joint pain and discontinue drug if appropriate. 5.7 Bullous Pemphigoid Postmarketing cases of bullous pemphigoid requiring hospitalization have been reported with DPP-4 inhibitor use. In reported cases, patients typically recovered with topical or systemic immunosuppressive treatment and discontinuation of the DPP-4 inhibitor. Tell patients to report development of blisters or erosions while receiving JANUVIA. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, JANUVIA should be discontinued and referral to a dermatologist should be considered for diagnosis and appropriate treatment."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following adverse reactions are also discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Pancreatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Heart Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Acute Renal Failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Hypoglycemia with Concomitant Use with Insulin or Insulin Secretagogues [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Hypersensitivity Reactions [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Severe and Disabling Arthralgia [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] Bullous Pemphigoid [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] Adverse reactions reported in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo are: upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and headache. In the add-on to sulfonylurea and add-on to insulin studies, hypoglycemia was also more commonly reported in patients treated with JANUVIA compared to placebo. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Merck Sharp & Dohme LLC at 1-877-888-4231 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In controlled clinical studies as both monotherapy and combination therapy with metformin, pioglitazone, or rosiglitazone and metformin, the overall incidence of adverse reactions, hypoglycemia, and discontinuation of therapy due to clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA were similar to placebo. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, the overall incidence of clinical adverse reactions with JANUVIA was higher than with placebo, in part related to a higher incidence of hypoglycemia (see Table 3); the incidence of discontinuation due to clinical adverse reactions was similar to placebo. Two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies, one of 18- and one of 24-week duration, included patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily, JANUVIA 200 mg daily, and placebo. Five placebo-controlled add-on combination therapy studies were also conducted: one with metformin; one with pioglitazone; one with metformin and rosiglitazone; one with glimepiride (with or without metformin); and one with insulin (with or without metformin). In these trials, patients with inadequate glycemic control on a stable dose of the background therapy were randomized to add-on therapy with JANUVIA 100 mg daily or placebo. The adverse reactions, excluding hypoglycemia, reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg daily and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo, are shown in Table 1 for the clinical trials of at least 18 weeks duration. Incidences of hypoglycemia are shown in Table 3.

In the 24-week study of patients receiving JANUVIA as add-on therapy to insulin (with or without metformin), there were no adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients and more commonly than in patients given placebo, except for hypoglycemia (see Table 3). In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 1), through Week 54 the adverse reactions reported regardless of investigator assessment of causality in \u22655% of patients treated with JANUVIA and more commonly than in patients treated with placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (JANUVIA, 15.5%; placebo, 6.2%), nasopharyngitis (11.0%, 9.3%), peripheral edema (8.3%, 5.2%), and headache (5.5%, 4.1%). In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the incidence of selected gastrointestinal adverse reactions in patients treated with JANUVIA was as follows: abdominal pain (JANUVIA 100 mg, 2.3%; placebo, 2.1%), nausea (1.4%, 0.6%), and diarrhea (3.0%, 2.3%). In an additional, 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with sitagliptin in combination with metformin, the adverse reactions reported (regardless of investigator assessment of causality) in \u22655% of patients are shown in Table 2. Table 2: Initial Therapy with Combination of Sitagliptin and Metformin: Adverse Reactions Reported (Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality) in \u22655% of Patients Receiving Combination Therapy (and Greater than in Patients Receiving Metformin alone, Sitagliptin alone, and Placebo) Intent-to-treat population. Number of Patients (%) Placebo Sitagliptin (JANUVIA) 100 mg QD Metformin HCl 500 or 1000 mg bid Data pooled for the patients given the lower and higher doses of metformin.

No clinically meaningful changes in vital signs or in ECG (including in QTc interval) were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA. In a pooled analysis of 19 double-blind clinical trials that included data from 10,246 patients randomized to receive sitagliptin 100 mg/day (N=5429) or corresponding (active or placebo) control (N=4817), the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 0.1 per 100 patient-years in each group (4 patients with an event in 4708 patient-years for sitagliptin and 4 patients with an event in 3942 patient-years for control). Hypoglycemia In the above studies (N=9), adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia. A concurrent blood glucose measurement was not required although most (74%) reports of hypoglycemia were accompanied by a blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL. When JANUVIA was coadministered with a sulfonylurea or with insulin, the percentage of patients with at least one adverse reaction of hypoglycemia was higher than in the corresponding placebo group (Table 3). Table 3: Incidence and Rate of Hypoglycemia Adverse reactions of hypoglycemia were based on all reports of symptomatic hypoglycemia; a concurrent glucose measurement was not required; intent-to-treat population. in Placebo-Controlled Clinical Studies when JANUVIA was used as Add-On Therapy to Glimepiride (with or without Metformin) or Insulin (with or without Metformin), Regardless of Investigator Assessment of Causality Add-On to Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Glimepiride (+/- Metformin) N = 222 N = 219 Overall (%) 27 (12.2) 4 (1.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) Based on total number of events (i.e., a single patient may have had multiple events). 0.59 0.24 Severe (%) Severe events of hypoglycemia were defined as those events requiring medical assistance or exhibiting depressed level/loss of consciousness or seizure. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Add-On to Insulin (+/- Metformin) (24 weeks) JANUVIA 100 mg + Insulin (+/- Metformin) Placebo + Insulin (+/- Metformin) N = 322 N = 319 Overall (%) 50 (15.5) 25 (7.8) Rate (episodes/patient-year) 1.06 0.51 Severe (%) 2 (0.6) 1 (0.3) In a pooled analysis of the two monotherapy studies, the add-on to metformin study, and the add-on to pioglitazone study, the overall incidence of adverse reactions of hypoglycemia was 1.2% in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 0.9% in patients treated with placebo. In the study of JANUVIA as add-on combination therapy with metformin and rosiglitazone, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 2.2% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 0.0% in patients given add-on placebo through Week 18. Through Week 54, the overall incidence of hypoglycemia was 3.9% in patients given add-on JANUVIA and 1.0% in patients given add-on placebo. In the 24-week, placebo-controlled factorial study of initial therapy with JANUVIA in combination with metformin, the incidence of hypoglycemia was 0.6% in patients given placebo, 0.6% in patients given JANUVIA alone, 0.8% in patients given metformin alone, and 1.6% in patients given JANUVIA in combination with metformin. In the study of JANUVIA as initial therapy with pioglitazone, one patient taking JANUVIA experienced a severe episode of hypoglycemia. There were no severe hypoglycemia episodes reported in other studies except in the study involving coadministration with insulin. In an additional, 30-week placebo-controlled, study of patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled with metformin comparing the maintenance of sitagliptin 100 mg versus withdrawal of sitagliptin when initiating basal insulin therapy, the event rate and incidence of documented symptomatic hypoglycemia (blood glucose measurement \u226470 mg/dL) did not differ between the sitagliptin and placebo groups. Laboratory Tests Across clinical studies, the incidence of laboratory adverse reactions was similar in patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg compared to patients treated with placebo. A small increase in white blood cell count (WBC) was observed due to an increase in neutrophils. This increase in WBC (of approximately 200 cells/microL vs placebo, in four pooled placebo-controlled clinical studies, with a mean baseline WBC count of approximately 6600 cells/microL) is not considered to be clinically relevant. In a 12-week study of 91 patients with chronic renal insufficiency, 37 patients with moderate renal insufficiency were randomized to JANUVIA 50 mg daily, while 14 patients with the same magnitude of renal impairment were randomized to placebo. Mean (SE) increases in serum creatinine were observed in patients treated with JANUVIA [0.12 mg/dL (0.04)] and in patients treated with placebo [0.07 mg/dL (0.07)]. The clinical significance of this added increase in serum creatinine relative to placebo is not known. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Additional adverse reactions have been identified during postapproval use of JANUVIA as monotherapy and/or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is generally not possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, angioedema, rash, urticaria, cutaneous vasculitis, and exfoliative skin conditions including Stevens-Johnson syndrome; hepatic enzyme elevations; acute pancreatitis, including fatal and non-fatal hemorrhagic and necrotizing pancreatitis [see Indications and Usage (1) ] ; worsening renal function, including acute renal failure (sometimes requiring dialysis), and tubulointerstitial nephritis; severe and disabling arthralgia ; bullous pemphigoid ; constipation; vomiting; headache; myalgia; pain in extremity; back pain; pruritus; mouth ulceration; stomatitis; rhabdomyolysis."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data with JANUVIA in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ]. No adverse developmental effects were observed when sitagliptin was administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at oral doses up to 30-times and 20-times, respectively, the 100 mg clinical dose, based on AUC [see Data ] . The estimated background risk of major birth defects is 6-10% in women with pre-gestational diabetes with a Hemoglobin A1c >7% and has been reported to be as high as 20-25% in women with a Hemoglobin A1c >10%. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Clinical Considerations Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal Risk Poorly controlled diabetes in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, pre-eclampsia, spontaneous abortions, preterm delivery, and delivery complications. Poorly controlled diabetes increases the fetal risk for major birth defects, still birth, and macrosomia related morbidity. Data Animal Data In embryo-fetal development studies, sitagliptin administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation day 6 to 20) did not adversely affect developmental outcomes at oral doses up to 250 mg/kg (30-times the 100 mg clinical dose) and 125 mg/kg (20-times the 100 mg clinical dose), respectively, based on AUC. Higher doses in rats associated with maternal toxicity increased the incidence of rib malformations in offspring at 1000 mg/kg, or approximately 100-times the clinical dose, based on AUC. Placental transfer of sitagliptin was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. Sitagliptin administered to female rats from gestation day 6 to lactation day 21 caused no functional or behavioral toxicity in offspring of rats at doses up to 1000 mg/kg. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information regarding the presence of JANUVIA in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Sitagliptin is present in rat milk and therefore possibly present in human milk [see Data ] . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for JANUVIA and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from JANUVIA or from the underlying maternal condition. Data Sitagliptin is secreted in the milk of lactating rats at a milk to plasma ratio of 4:1. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of JANUVIA have not been established in pediatric patients. Three 20-week double-blind, placebo-controlled studies each with 34-week extensions were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in 410 pediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes, with or without insulin therapy (HbA1c 6.5-10% for patients not on insulin, HbA1c 7-10% for patients on insulin). At study entry, patients in study 1 were not treated with oral antihyperglycemic agents; patients in studies 2 and 3 were on maximally tolerated metformin therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline in HbA1c after 20 weeks of therapy. The pre-specified primary efficacy analyses included data from study 1 and pooled data from studies 2 and 3, regardless of glycemic rescue or treatment discontinuation. In both efficacy analyses, the effect of treatment with sitagliptin was not significantly different from placebo. In study 1, the mean baseline HbA1c was 7.5%, and 12% of patients were on insulin therapy. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with JANUVIA (N=95) was 0.06% compared to 0.23% in patients treated with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.17% (95% CI: -0.62, 0.28). In studies 2 and 3, the mean baseline HbA1c was 8.0%, 15% of patients were on insulin and 72% were on metformin HCl doses of greater than 1,500 mg daily. At week 20, the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin (N=107) was -0.23% compared to 0.09% in patients treated with placebo (N=113), a difference of -0.33% (95% CI: -0.70, 0.05). 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the total number of subjects (N=3884) in pre-approval clinical safety and efficacy studies of JANUVIA, 725 patients were 65 years and over, while 61 patients were 75 years and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between subjects 65 years and over and younger subjects. While this and other reported clinical experience have not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. Because sitagliptin is substantially excreted by the kidney, and because aging can be associated with reduced renal function, renal function should be assessed more frequently in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment Sitagliptin is excreted by the kidney, and sitagliptin exposure is increased in patients with renal impairment. Lower dosages are recommended in patients with eGFR less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 (moderate and severe renal impairment, as well as in ESRD patients requiring dialysis).

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%). Elimination Approximately 79% of sitagliptin is excreted unchanged in the urine with metabolism being a minor pathway of elimination. The apparent terminal t 1/2 following a 100 mg oral dose of sitagliptin was approximately 12.4 hours and renal clearance was approximately 350 mL/min. Metabolism Following a [ 14 C]sitagliptin oral dose, approximately 16% of the radioactivity was excreted as metabolites of sitagliptin. Six metabolites were detected at trace levels and are not expected to contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of sitagliptin. In vitro studies indicated that the primary enzyme responsible for the limited metabolism of sitagliptin was CYP3A4, with contribution from CYP2C8. Excretion Following administration of an oral [ 14 C]sitagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 100% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces (13%) or urine (87%) within one week of dosing. Elimination of sitagliptin occurs primarily via renal excretion and involves active tubular secretion. Sitagliptin is a substrate for human organic anion transporter-3 (hOAT-3), which may be involved in the renal elimination of sitagliptin. The clinical relevance of hOAT-3 in sitagliptin transport has not been established. Sitagliptin is also a substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), which may also be involved in mediating the renal elimination of sitagliptin. However, cyclosporine, a P-gp inhibitor, did not reduce the renal clearance of sitagliptin. Specific Populations Patients with Renal Impairment An approximately 2-fold increase in the plasma AUC of sitagliptin was observed in patients with moderate renal impairment with eGFR of 30 to less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , and an approximately 4-fold increase was observed in patients with severe renal impairment, including patients with ESRD on hemodialysis, as compared to normal healthy control subjects. Patients with Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score 7 to 9), mean AUC and C max of sitagliptin increased approximately 21% and 13%, respectively, compared to healthy matched controls following administration of a single 100-mg dose of sitagliptin. These differences are not considered to be clinically meaningful. There is no clinical experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score >9). Effects of Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), Gender, and Race Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis or a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, BMI, gender, and race do not have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. When the effects of age on renal function are taken into account, age alone did not have a clinically meaningful impact on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Elderly subjects (65 to 80 years) had approximately 19% higher plasma concentrations of sitagliptin compared to younger subjects. Drug Interaction Studies In Vitro Assessment of Drug Interactions Sitagliptin is not an inhibitor of CYP isozymes CYP3A4, 2C8, 2C9, 2D6, 1A2, 2C19 or 2B6, and is not an inducer of CYP3A4. Sitagliptin is a P-gp substrate, but does not inhibit P-gp mediated transport of digoxin. Based on these results, sitagliptin is considered unlikely to cause interactions with other drugs that utilize these pathways. Sitagliptin is not extensively bound to plasma proteins. Therefore, the propensity of sitagliptin to be involved in clinically meaningful drug-drug interactions mediated by plasma protein binding displacement is very low. In Vivo Assessment of Drug Interactions Effects of Sitagliptin on Other Drugs In clinical studies, sitagliptin did not meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, rosiglitazone, digoxin, warfarin, or an oral contraceptive (ethinyl estradiol and norethindrone) (Table 4), providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing drug interactions with substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, P-gp, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Sitagliptin is a DPP-4 inhibitor, which is believed to exert its actions in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by slowing the inactivation of incretin hormones. Concentrations of the active intact hormones are increased by sitagliptin, thereby increasing and prolonging the action of these hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), are released by the intestine throughout the day, and levels are increased in response to a meal. These hormones are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme, DPP-4. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiologic regulation of glucose homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin synthesis and release from pancreatic beta cells by intracellular signaling pathways involving cyclic AMP. GLP-1 also lowers glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. By increasing and prolonging active incretin levels, sitagliptin increases insulin release and decreases glucagon levels in the circulation in a glucose-dependent manner. Sitagliptin demonstrates selectivity for DPP-4 and does not inhibit DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro at concentrations approximating those from therapeutic doses."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics General In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, administration of sitagliptin led to inhibition of DPP-4 enzyme activity for a 24-hour period. After an oral glucose load or a meal, this DPP-4 inhibition resulted in a 2- to 3-fold increase in circulating levels of active GLP-1 and GIP, decreased glucagon concentrations, and increased responsiveness of insulin release to glucose, resulting in higher C-peptide and insulin concentrations. The rise in insulin with the decrease in glucagon was associated with lower fasting glucose concentrations and reduced glucose excursion following an oral glucose load or a meal. In studies with healthy subjects, sitagliptin did not lower blood glucose or cause hypoglycemia. Sitagliptin and Metformin hydrochloride Coadministration In a two-day study in healthy subjects, sitagliptin alone increased active GLP-1 concentrations, whereas metformin alone increased active and total GLP-1 concentrations to similar extents. Coadministration of sitagliptin and metformin had an additive effect on active GLP-1 concentrations. Sitagliptin, but not metformin, increased active GIP concentrations. It is unclear how these findings relate to changes in glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Cardiac Electrophysiology In a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, 79 healthy subjects were administered a single oral dose of sitagliptin 100 mg, sitagliptin 800 mg (8 times the recommended dose), and placebo. At the recommended dose of 100 mg, there was no effect on the QTc interval obtained at the peak plasma concentration, or at any other time during the study. Following the 800 mg dose, the maximum increase in the placebo-corrected mean change in QTc from baseline was observed at 3 hours postdose and was 8.0 msec. This increase is not considered to be clinically significant. At the 800 mg dose, peak sitagliptin plasma concentrations were approximately 11 times higher than the peak concentrations following a 100-mg dose. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus administered sitagliptin 100 mg (N=81) or sitagliptin 200 mg (N=63) daily, there were no meaningful changes in QTc interval based on ECG data obtained at the time of expected peak plasma concentration."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin have been extensively characterized in healthy subjects and patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following a single oral 100-mg dose to healthy volunteers, mean plasma AUC of sitagliptin was 8.52 \u03bcM\u2022hr, C max was 950 nM, and apparent terminal half-life (t 1/2 ) was 12.4 hours. Plasma AUC of sitagliptin increased in a dose-proportional manner and increased approximately 14% following 100 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for sitagliptin AUC were small (5.8% and 15.1%). The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin was generally similar in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Absorption After oral administration of a 100 mg dose to healthy subjects, sitagliptin was rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations (median T max ) occurring 1 to 4 hours postdose. The absolute bioavailability of sitagliptin is approximately 87%. Effect of Food Coadministration of a high-fat meal with sitagliptin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin. Distribution The mean volume of distribution at steady state following a single 100-mg intravenous dose of sitagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 198 liters. The fraction of sitagliptin reversibly bound to plasma proteins is low (38%).

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female rats given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was an increased incidence of combined liver adenoma/carcinoma in males and females and of liver carcinoma in females at 500 mg/kg. This dose results in exposures approximately 60 times the human exposure at the maximum recommended daily adult human dose (MRHD) of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons. Liver tumors were not observed at 150 mg/kg, approximately 20 times the human exposure at the MRHD. A two-year carcinogenicity study was conducted in male and female mice given oral doses of sitagliptin of 50, 125, 250, and 500 mg/kg/day. There was no increase in the incidence of tumors in any organ up to 500 mg/kg, approximately 70 times human exposure at the MRHD. Sitagliptin was not mutagenic or clastogenic with or without metabolic activation in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity assay, a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) chromosome aberration assay, an in vitro cytogenetics assay in CHO, an in vitro rat hepatocyte DNA alkaline elution assay, and an in vivo micronucleus assay. In rat fertility studies with oral gavage doses of 125, 250, and 1000 mg/kg, males were treated for 4 weeks prior to mating, during mating, up to scheduled termination (approximately 8 weeks total) and females were treated 2 weeks prior to mating through gestation day 7. No adverse effect on fertility was observed at 125 mg/kg (approximately 12 times human exposure at the MRHD of 100 mg/day based on AUC comparisons). At higher doses, nondose-related increased resorptions in females were observed (approximately 25 and 100 times human exposure at the MRHD based on AUC comparison)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES There were approximately 5200 patients with type 2 diabetes randomized in nine double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical safety and efficacy studies conducted to evaluate the effects of sitagliptin on glycemic control. In a pooled analysis of seven of these studies, the ethnic/racial distribution was approximately 59% white, 20% Hispanic, 10% Asian, 6% black, and 6% other groups. Patients had an overall mean age of approximately 55 years (range 18 to 87 years). In addition, an active (glipizide)-controlled study of 52-weeks duration was conducted in 1172 patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycemic control on metformin. In patients with type 2 diabetes, treatment with JANUVIA produced clinically significant improvements in hemoglobin A1C, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. 14.1 Monotherapy A total of 1262 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one of 18-week and another of 24-week duration, to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JANUVIA monotherapy. In both monotherapy studies, patients currently on an antihyperglycemic agent discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of about 7 weeks. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) after the washout period were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period; patients not currently on antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized after completing the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. In the 18-week study, 521 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg, and in the 24-week study 741 patients were randomized to placebo, JANUVIA 100 mg, or JANUVIA 200 mg. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue, added on to placebo or JANUVIA. Treatment with JANUVIA at 100 mg daily provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 6). In the 18-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 17% who received placebo required rescue therapy. In the 24-week study, 9% of patients receiving JANUVIA 100 mg and 21% of patients receiving placebo required rescue therapy. The improvement in A1C compared to placebo was not affected by gender, age, race, prior antihyperglycemic therapy, or baseline BMI. As is typical for trials of agents to treat type 2 diabetes, the mean reduction in A1C with JANUVIA appears to be related to the degree of A1C elevation at baseline. In these 18- and 24-week studies, among patients who were not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, the reductions from baseline in A1C were -0.7% and -0.8%, respectively, for those given JANUVIA, and -0.1% and -0.2%, respectively, for those given placebo. Overall, the 200 mg daily dose did not provide greater glycemic efficacy than the 100 mg daily dose. The effect of JANUVIA on lipid endpoints was similar to placebo. Body weight did not increase from baseline with JANUVIA therapy in either study, compared to a small reduction in patients given placebo.

Patients with moderate renal insufficiency received 50 mg daily of JANUVIA and those with severe renal insufficiency or with ESRD on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis received 25 mg daily. In this study, the safety and tolerability of JANUVIA were generally similar to placebo. A small increase in serum creatinine was reported in patients with moderate renal insufficiency treated with JANUVIA relative to those on placebo. In addition, the reductions in A1C and FPG with JANUVIA compared to placebo were generally similar to those observed in other monotherapy studies. [See Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) .] 14.2 Combination Therapy Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin A total of 701 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with metformin. Patients already on metformin HCl (N=431) at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients on metformin and another antihyperglycemic agent (N=229) and patients not on any antihyperglycemic agents (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=41) were randomized after a run-in period of approximately 10 weeks on metformin HCl (at a dose of at least 1500 mg per day) in monotherapy. Patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin (Table 7). Rescue glycemic therapy was used in 5% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. A similar decrease in body weight was observed for both treatment groups.

Patients on an antihyperglycemic agent (N=541) discontinued the agent, and underwent a diet, exercise, and drug washout period of up to 12 weeks duration. After the washout period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized after completing a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period. Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (N=550) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with placebo, 100 mg of JANUVIA once daily, 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily, or 50 mg of sitagliptin twice daily in combination with 500 mg or 1000 mg of metformin HCl twice daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glyburide (glibenclamide) rescue. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and metformin provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo, to metformin alone, and to JANUVIA alone (Table 8, Figure 1). Mean reductions from baseline in A1C were generally greater for patients with higher baseline A1C values. For patients not on an antihyperglycemic agent at study entry, mean reductions from baseline in A1C were: JANUVIA 100 mg once daily, -1.1%; metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.1%; metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.2%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 500 mg bid, -1.6%; sitagliptin 50 mg bid with metformin HCl 1000 mg bid, -1.9%; and for patients receiving placebo, -0.2%. Lipid effects were generally neutral. The decrease in body weight in the groups given sitagliptin in combination with metformin was similar to that in the groups given metformin alone or placebo.

Initial combination therapy or maintenance of combination therapy may not be appropriate for all patients. These management options are left to the discretion of the health care provider. Active-Controlled Study vs Glipizide in Combination with Metformin The efficacy of JANUVIA was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, glipizide-controlled noninferiority trial in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients not on treatment or on other antihyperglycemic agents entered a run-in treatment period of up to 12 weeks duration with metformin HCl monotherapy (dose of \u22651500 mg per day) which included washout of medications other than metformin, if applicable. After the run-in period, those with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 6.5% to 10%) were randomized 1:1 to the addition of JANUVIA 100 mg once daily or glipizide for 52 weeks. Patients receiving glipizide were given an initial dosage of 5 mg/day and then electively titrated over the next 18 weeks to a maximum dosage of 20 mg/day as needed to optimize glycemic control. Thereafter, the glipizide dose was to be kept constant, except for down-titration to prevent hypoglycemia. The mean dose of glipizide after the titration period was 10 mg. After 52 weeks, JANUVIA and glipizide had similar mean reductions from baseline in A1C in the intent-to-treat analysis (Table 9). These results were consistent with the per protocol analysis (Figure 2). A conclusion in favor of the non-inferiority of JANUVIA to glipizide may be limited to patients with baseline A1C comparable to those included in the study (over 70% of patients had baseline A1C <8% and over 90% had A1C <9%). Table 9: Glycemic Parameters in a 52-Week Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Intent-to-Treat Population) The intent-to-treat analysis used the patients' last observation in the study prior to discontinuation. JANUVIA 100 mg Glipizide A1C (%) N = 576 N = 559 Baseline (mean) 7.7 7.6 Change from baseline (adjusted mean Least squares means adjusted for prior antihyperglycemic therapy status and baseline A1C value. ) -0.5 -0.6 FPG (mg/dL) N = 583 N = 568 Baseline (mean) 166 164 Change from baseline (adjusted mean ) -8 -8 Figure 2: Mean Change from Baseline for A1C (%) Over 52 Weeks in a Study Comparing JANUVIA to Glipizide as Add-On Therapy in Patients Inadequately Controlled on Metformin (Per Protocol Population) The per protocol population (mean baseline A1C of 7.5%) included patients without major protocol violations who had observations at baseline and at Week 52. The incidence of hypoglycemia in the JANUVIA group (4.9%) was significantly (p<0.001) lower than that in the glipizide group (32.0%). Patients treated with JANUVIA exhibited a significant mean decrease from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered glipizide (-1.5 kg vs +1.1 kg). Add-on Combination Therapy with Pioglitazone A total of 353 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone. Patients on any oral antihyperglycemic agent in monotherapy (N=212) or on a PPAR\u03b3 agent in combination therapy (N=106) or not on an antihyperglycemic agent (off therapy for at least 8 weeks, N=34) were switched to monotherapy with pioglitazone (at a dose of 30-45 mg per day), and completed a run-in period of approximately 12 weeks in duration. After the run-in period on pioglitazone monotherapy, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7% to 10%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with metformin rescue. Glycemic endpoints measured were A1C and fasting glucose. In combination with pioglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo with pioglitazone (Table 10). Rescue therapy was used in 7% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 14% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change.

Patients not on antihyperglycemic agents at study entry (<4 weeks cumulative therapy over the past 2 years, and with no treatment over the prior 4 months) with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 8% to 12%) immediately entered the 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period and then were randomized. Approximately equal numbers of patients were randomized to receive initial therapy with 100 mg of JANUVIA in combination with 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily or 30 mg of pioglitazone once daily as monotherapy. There was no glycemic rescue therapy in this study. Initial therapy with the combination of JANUVIA and pioglitazone provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to pioglitazone monotherapy (Table 11). The improvement in A1C was generally consistent across subgroups defined by gender, age, race, baseline BMI, baseline A1C, or duration of disease. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA in combination with pioglitazone had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg compared to pioglitazone alone (3.0 kg vs. 1.9 kg). Lipid effects were generally neutral.

Patients on dual therapy with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day or with metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and pioglitazone \u226530 mg/day (switched to rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day) entered a dose-stable run-in period of 6 weeks. Patients on other dual therapy were switched to metformin HCl \u22651500 mg/day and rosiglitazone \u22654 mg/day in a dose titration/stabilization run-in period of up to 20 weeks in duration. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized 2:1 to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the study were treated with glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue. The primary time point for evaluation of glycemic parameters was Week 18. In combination with metformin and rosiglitazone, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo with metformin and rosiglitazone (Table 12) at Week 18. At Week 54, mean reduction in A1C was -1.0% for patients treated with JANUVIA and -0.3% for patients treated with placebo in an analysis based on the intent-to-treat population. Rescue therapy was used in 18% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 40% of patients treated with placebo. There was no significant difference between JANUVIA and placebo in body weight change. Table 12: Glycemic Parameters at Week 18 for JANUVIA in Add-on Combination Therapy with Metformin and Rosiglitazone Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to glipizide (or other sulfonylurea) rescue therapy.

Patients entered a run-in treatment period on glimepiride (\u22654 mg per day) alone or glimepiride in combination with metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). After a dose-titration and dose-stable run-in period of up to 16 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 10.5%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the studies were treated with pioglitazone rescue. In combination with glimepiride, with or without metformin, JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C and FPG compared to placebo (Table 13). In the entire study population (patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and patients on JANUVIA in combination with glimepiride and metformin), a mean reduction from baseline relative to placebo in A1C of -0.7% and in FPG of -20 mg/dL was seen. Rescue therapy was used in 12% of patients treated with JANUVIA 100 mg and 27% of patients treated with placebo. In this study, patients treated with JANUVIA had a mean increase in body weight of 1.1 kg vs. placebo (+0.8 kg vs. -0.4 kg). In addition, there was an increased rate of hypoglycemia.

(-32, -7) -21 (-32, -10) Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin (with or without Metformin) A total of 641 patients with type 2 diabetes participated in a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to assess the efficacy of JANUVIA as add-on to insulin therapy (with or without metformin). The racial distribution in this study was approximately 70% white, 18% Asian, 7% black, and 5% other groups. Approximately 14% of the patients in this study were Hispanic. Patients entered a 2-week, single-blind run-in treatment period on pre-mixed, long-acting, or intermediate-acting insulin, with or without metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg per day). Patients using short-acting insulins were excluded unless the short-acting insulin was administered as part of a pre-mixed insulin. After the run-in period, patients with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were randomized to the addition of either 100 mg of JANUVIA or placebo, administered once daily. Patients were on a stable dose of insulin prior to enrollment with no changes in insulin dose permitted during the run-in period. Patients who failed to meet specific glycemic goals during the double-blind treatment period were to have uptitration of the background insulin dose as rescue therapy. The median daily insulin dose at baseline was 42 units in the patients treated with JANUVIA and 45 units in the placebo-treated patients. The median change from baseline in daily dose of insulin was zero for both groups at the end of the study. In combination with insulin (with or without metformin), JANUVIA provided significant improvements in A1C, FPG, and 2-hour PPG compared to placebo (Table 14). Both treatment groups had an adjusted mean increase in body weight of 0.1 kg from baseline to Week 24. There was an increased rate of hypoglycemia in patients treated with JANUVIA. [See Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ; Adverse Reactions (6.1) .] Table 14: Glycemic Parameters at Final Visit (24-Week Study) for JANUVIA as Add-on Combination Therapy with Insulin Intent-to-treat population using last observation on study prior to rescue therapy.

Patients who were on a stable dose of metformin HCl (\u22651500 mg/day) in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor and/or sulfonylurea but with inadequate glycemic control (A1C 7.5% to 11%) were enrolled in the study. Those on metformin and JANUVIA (100 mg/day) directly entered the double-blind treatment period; those on another DPP-4 inhibitor and/or on a sulfonylurea entered a 4-8 week run-in period in which they were maintained on metformin and switched to JANUVIA (100 mg); other DPP-4 inhibitors and sulfonylureas were discontinued. At randomization patients were randomized either to continue JANUVIA or to discontinue JANUVIA and switch to a matching placebo. On the day of randomization, insulin glargine was initiated at a dose of 10 units subcutaneously in the evening. Patients were instructed to uptitrate their insulin dose in the evening based on fasting blood glucose measurements to achieve a target of 72-100 mg/dL. At 30 weeks, the mean reduction in A1C was greater in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group (Table 15). At the end of the trial, 27.3% of patients in the sitagliptin group and 27.3% in the placebo group had a fasting plasma glucose (FPG) in the target range; there was no significant difference in insulin dose between arms.
