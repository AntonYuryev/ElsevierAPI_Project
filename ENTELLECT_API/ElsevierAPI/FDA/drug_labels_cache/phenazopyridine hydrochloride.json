    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is light or dark red to dark violet, odorless, slightly bitter, crystalline powder. It has a specific local analgesic effect in the urinary tract, promptly relieving burning and pain. It has the following structural formula: Inactive Ingredients: Corn Starch, Croscarmellose Sodium, D&C Yellow #10 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Red #40 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Blue #1 Aluminum Lake, FD&C Yellow #6 Aluminum Lake, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Magnesium Stearate, Povidone, Polyvinyl Alcohol, Polyethylene Glycol, Pregelatinized Starch, Silicon Dioxide, Talc, and Titanium Dioxide."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine HCl is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is not known. The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine HCl have not been determined. Phenazopyridine HCl is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, with as much as 66% of an oral dose being excreted unchanged in the urine."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.)"

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine HCl should not be used in patients who have previously exhibited hypersensitivity to it. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Headache, rash, pruritus and occasional gastrointestinal disturbance. An anaphylactoid-like reaction has been described. Methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, renal and hepatic toxicity have been reported, usually at overdosage levels (see OVERDOSAGE Section )."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: A yellowish tinge of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation due to impaired renal excretion and the need to discontinue therapy. The decline in renal function associated with advanced age should be kept in mind. NOTE: Patients should be informed that Phenazopyridine HCl produces a reddish-orange discoloration of the urine and may stain fabric. Staining of contact lenses has been reported. Laboratory Test Interaction: Due to its properties as an azo dye, Phenazopyridine HCl may interfere with urinalysis based on spectrometry or color reactions. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing mothers: No information is available on the appearance of Phenazopyridine HCl, or its metabolites in human milk."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Exceeding the recommended dose in patients with good renal function or administering the usual dose to patients with impaired renal function (common in elderly patients) may lead to increased serum levels and toxic reactions. Methemoglobinemia generally follows a massive, acute overdose. Methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg/body weight intravenously or ascorbic acid 100 to 200 mg given orally should cause prompt reduction of the methemoglobinemia and disappearance of the cyanosis which is an aid in diagnosis. Oxidative Heinz body hemolytic anemia may also occur, and \u201cbite cells\u201d (degmacytes) may be present in a chronic overdosage situation.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is unknown. PHARMACOKINETICS The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride have not been determined. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and its metabolites are rapidly excreted by the kidneys. In a small number of healthy subjects, 90% of a 600 mg/day oral dose of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours, 41% as unchanged drug and 49% as metabolites."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See Dosage and Administration .)"
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe liver disease, severe hepatitis or pyelonephritis of pregnancy. It should be used cautiously in the presence of GI disturbances."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is unknown. PHARMACOKINETICS The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride have not been determined. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and its metabolites are rapidly excreted by the kidneys. In a small number of healthy subjects, 90% of a 600 mg/day oral dose of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours, 41% as unchanged drug and 49% as metabolites."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See Dosage and Administration .)"
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe liver disease, severe hepatitis or pyelonephritis of pregnancy. It should be used cautiously in the presence of GI disturbances."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See Dosage and Administration .)"

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe liver disease, severe hepatitis or pyelonephritis of pregnancy. It should be used cautiously in the presence of GI disturbances."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice.

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section)."

When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is unknown. PHARMACOKINETICS The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride have not been determined. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and its metabolites are rapidly excreted by the kidneys. In a small number of healthy subjects, 90% of a 600 mg/day oral dose of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours, 41% as unchanged drug and 49% as metabolites."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See Dosage and Administration .)"
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe liver disease, severe hepatitis or pyelonephritis of pregnancy. It should be used cautiously in the presence of GI disturbances."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

      "PRECAUTIONS General: A yellowish tinge of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation due to impaired renal excretion and the need to discontinue therapy. The decline in renal function associated with advanced age should be kept in mind. NOTE: Patients should be informed that Phenazopyridine HCl produces a reddish-orange discoloration of the urine and may stain fabric. Staining of contact lenses has been reported. Laboratory Test Interaction: Due to its properties as an azo dye, Phenazopyridine HCl may interfere with urinalysis based on spectrometry or color reactions. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Exceeding the recommended dose in patients with good renal function or administering the usual dose to patients with impaired renal function (common in elderly patients) may lead to increased serum levels and toxic reactions.

      "DESCRIPTION Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride, USP is light or dark red to dark violet, odorless, slightly bitter, crystalline powder. It has a specific local analgesic effect in the urinary tract, promptly relieving burning and pain. It has the following structural formula: C 11 H 11 N 5 \u2022HCl M.W. 249.70 Phenazopyridine HCl tablets, USP contain the following inactive ingredients: carnauba wax, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, povidone, pregelatinized starch."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine HCl is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is not known. The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine HCl have not been determined. Phenazopyridine HCl is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, with as much as 66% of an oral dose being excreted unchanged in the urine."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section)."

The decline in renal function associated with advanced age should be kept in mind. NOTE: Patients should be informed that Phenazopyridine HCl produces a reddish-orange discoloration of the urine and may stain fabric. Staining of contact lenses has been reported. Laboratory Test Interaction Due to its properties as an azo dye, Phenazopyridine HCl may interfere with urinalysis based on spectrometry or color reactions. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers No information is available on the appearance of Phenazopyridine HCl, or its metabolites in human milk."

When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is unknown. PHARMACOKINETICS The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride have not been determined. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and its metabolites are rapidly excreted by the kidneys. In a small number of healthy subjects, 90% of a 600 mg/day oral dose of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours, 41% as unchanged drug and 49% as metabolites."

    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See Dosage and Administration .)"
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe liver disease, severe hepatitis or pyelonephritis of pregnancy. It should be used cautiously in the presence of GI disturbances."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Repackaged By / Distributed By: RemedyRepack Inc. 625 Kolter Drive, Indiana, PA 15701 (724) 465-8762 Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is not known. The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine HCl have not been determined. Phenazopyridine HCl is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, with as much as 66% of an oral dose being excreted unchanged in the urine."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section)."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General A yellowish tinge of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation due to impaired renal excretion and the need to discontinue therapy. The decline in renal function associated with advanced age should be kept in mind. NOTE: Patients should be informed that Phenazopyridine HCl produces a reddish-orange discoloration of the urine and may stain fabric. Staining of contact lenses has been reported. Laboratory Test Interaction Due to its properties as an azo dye, Phenazopyridine HCl may interfere with urinalysis based on spectrometry or color reactions. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers No information is available on the appearance of Phenazopyridine HCl, or its metabolites in human milk."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Exceeding the recommended dose in patients with good renal function or administering the usual dose to patients with impaired renal function (common in elderly patients) may lead to increased serum levels and toxic reactions. Methemoglobinemia generally follows a massive, acute overdose. Methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg/body weight intravenously or ascorbic acid 100 to 200 mg given orally should cause prompt reduction of the methemoglobinemia and disappearance of the cyanosis which is an aid in diagnosis. Oxidative Heinz body hemolytic anemia may also occur, and \u201cbite cells\u201d (degmacytes) may be present in a chronic overdosage situation. Red blood cell G-6-PD deficiency may predispose to hemolysis. Renal and hepatic impairment and occasional failure, usually due to hypersensitivity, may also occur."

When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

The decline in renal function associated with advanced age should be kept in mind. While our product does not contain Sulfur, it has been indicated to exhibit in rare circumstances a sulfur-type reaction. Use of this product in patients sensitive to sulfur should be done so under the supervision of a Physician. NOTE : Patients should be informed that Phenazopyridine HCl produces a reddish-orange discoloration of the urine and may stain fabric. Staining of contact lenses has been reported. Laboratory Test Interaction: Due to its properties as an azo dye, Phenazopyridine HCl may interfere with urinalysis based on spectrometry or color reactions. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.

Methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg/body weight intravenously or ascorbic acid 100 to 200 mg given orally should cause prompt reduction of the methemoglobinemia and disappearance of the cyanosis which is an aid in diagnosis. Oxidative Heinz body hemolytic anemia may also occur, and \"bite cells\" (degmacytes) may be present in a chronic overdosage situation. Red blood cell G-6-PD deficiency may predispose to hemolysis.

Methemoglobinemia generally follows a massive, acute overdose. Methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg/body weight intravenously or ascorbic acid 100 to 200 mg given orally should cause prompt reduction of the methemoglobinemia and disappearance of the cyanosis which is an aid in diagnosis. Oxidative Heinz body hemolytic anemia may also occur, and \u201cbite cells\u201d (degmacytes) may be present in a chronic overdosage situation.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is unknown. PHARMACOKINETICS The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride have not been determined. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and its metabolites are rapidly excreted by the kidneys. In a small number of healthy subjects, 90% of a 600 mg/day oral dose of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours, 41% as unchanged drug and 49% as metabolites."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See Dosage and Administration .)"
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe liver disease, severe hepatitis or pyelonephritis of pregnancy. It should be used cautiously in the presence of GI disturbances."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Category B: Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women.

      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is not known. The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine HCl have not been determined. Phenazopyridine HCl is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, with as much as 66% of an oral dose being excreted unchanged in the urine."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section)."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General A yellowish tinge of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation due to impaired renal excretion and the need to discontinue therapy. The decline in renal function associated with advanced age should be kept in mind. NOTE: Patients should be informed that Phenazopyridine HCl produces a reddish-orange discoloration of the urine and may stain fabric. Staining of contact lenses has been reported. Laboratory Test Interaction Due to its properties as an azo dye, Phenazopyridine HCl may interfere with urinalysis based on spectrometry or color reactions. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

      "OVERDOSAGE Exceeding the recommended dose in patients with good renal function or administering the usual dose to patients with impaired renal function (common in elderly patients) may lead to increased serum levels and toxic reactions. Methemoglobinemia generally follows a massive, acute overdose. Methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg/body weight intravenously or ascorbic acid 100 to 200 mg given orally should cause prompt reduction of the methemoglobinemia and disappearance of the cyanosis which is an aid in diagnosis. Oxidative Heinz body hemolytic anemia may also occur, and \u201cbite cells\u201d (degmacytes) may be present in a chronic overdosage situation. Red blood cell G-6-PD deficiency may predispose to hemolysis. Renal and hepatic impairment and occasional failure, usually due to hypersensitivity, may also occur."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see Error!

      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine hydrochloride is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is unknown. PHARMACOKINETICS The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride have not been determined. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and its metabolites are rapidly excreted by the kidneys. In a small number of healthy subjects, 90% of a 600 mg/day oral dose of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride was eliminated in the urine in 24 hours, 41% as unchanged drug and 49% as metabolites."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the mucosa of the lower urinary tract caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. The drug should be used for symptomatic relief of pain and not as a substitute for specific surgery or antimicrobial therapy. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is compatible with antimicrobial therapy and can help relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antimicrobial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not exceed 2 days. There is no evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride and an antimicrobial provides greater benefit than administration of the antimicrobial alone after 2 days. (See Dosage and Administration .)"

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should not be used in patients who are hypersensitive to the drug or its ingredients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency, severe liver disease, severe hepatitis or pyelonephritis of pregnancy. It should be used cautiously in the presence of GI disturbances."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section)."

Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride is reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals (IARC 1980, 1982, 1987, NCI 1978). When administered in the diet, Phenazopyridine hydrochloride increased the incidences of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas in female mice and adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon and rectum in rats of both sexes. There is inadequate evidence for the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine hydrochloride in humans (TARC 1987). In one limited epidemiological study, no significant excess of any cancer was observed among 2,214 patients who received Phenazopyridine hydrochloride and were followed for a minimum of 3 years."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General The patient should be advised that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride produces an orange to red color in the urine and feces, and may cause staining. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. A yellowish color of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride resulting from impaired renal function and necessitates discontinuance of the drug. It should be noted that a decline in renal function is common in elderly patients. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may mask pathological conditions and interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, spectrophotometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Cautious use in patients with G-6-PD deficiency is advised since these patients are susceptible to oxidative hemolysis and may have greater potential to develop hemolytic anemia. Information for Patients The patient should be advised to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with or following food or after eating a snack to reduce stomach upset. The patients should be aware that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride causes a reddish orange discoloration of the urine and feces, and may stain clothing. Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may cause discoloration of body fluids and staining of contact lenses has been reported. There have been reports of teeth discoloration when the product has been broken or held in the mouth prior to swallowing. Patients should be instructed to take Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride for only 2 days if an antibacterial agent is administered concurrently for the treatment of a urinary tract infection. If symptoms persist beyond those 2 days, the patient should be instructed to contact his or her physician. Laboratory Tests Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride may interfere with laboratory test values using colorimetric, photometric or fluorometric analysis methods. Altered urine laboratory test values may include ketone (sodium nitroprusside) bilirubin (foam test, talc-disk-Fouchet-spot test, Franklin's tablet-Fouchet test, p-nitrobenzene diazonium p-toluene sulfonate reagent), diacetic acid (Gerhardt ferric chloride test), free hydrochloric acid, glucose (glucose oxidase tests), 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (modified Glenn-Nelson), 17-ketosteroids (Holtorff Koch modification of Zimmerman), porphyrins, albumin (discolors bromophenol blue test areas of commercial reagent strips, nitric acid ring test), phenolsulfophthalein, urobilinogen (color interference with Ehrlich's reagent), and urinalysis (spectrophotometric or color-based tests). Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride also imparts an orange-red color to stools which may interfere with color tests. Drug Interactions The interaction of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride with other drugs has not been studied in a systematic manner. However, the medical literature to date suggests that no significant interactions have been reported. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride has been associated with tumors of the large intestine in rats and of the liver in mice. Available epidemiological data are insufficient to evaluate the carcinogenicity of Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in humans. In vitro studies indicate that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride in the presence of metabolic activation is mutagenic in bacteria and mutagenic and clastogenic in mammalian cells. Pregnancy Category B Reproductive studies with Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride (in combination with sulfacytine) in rats given up to 110 mg/kg/day and in rabbits given up to 39 mg/kg/day during organogenesis revealed no evidence of harm to offspring. One prospective study in humans demonstrated that Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride traverses the placenta into the fetal compartment. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Therefore, Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride should be used in pregnant women only if the benefit clearly outweighs the risk. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, a decision should be made to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of drug therapy to the mother. Children Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in the pediatric population. No pediatric-specific problems have been documented."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see Error!

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Phenazopyridine HCl is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is not known. The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine HCl have not been determined. Phenazopyridine HCl is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, with as much as 66% of an oral dose being excreted unchanged in the urine."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section)."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Phenazopyridine HCl should not be used in patients who have previously exhibited hypersensitivity to it. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Headache, rash, pruritus and occasional gastrointestinal disturbance. An anaphylactoid-like reaction has been described. Methemoglobinemia, hemolytic anemia, renal and hepatic toxicity have been reported, usually at overdosage levels (see OVERDOSAGE section).

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General A yellowish tinge of the skin or sclera may indicate accumulation due to impaired renal excretion and the need to discontinue therapy. The decline in renal function associated with advanced age should be kept in mind. NOTE: Patients should be informed that Phenazopyridine HCl produces a reddish-orange discoloration of the urine and may stain fabric. Staining of contact lenses has been reported. Laboratory Test Interaction Due to its properties as an azo dye, Phenazopyridine HCl may interfere with urinalysis based on spectrometry or color reactions. Carcinogenicity, Mutagenicity, Impairment of Fertility Long-term administration of Phenazopyridine HCl has induced neoplasia in rats (large intestine) and mice (liver). Although no association between Phenazopyridine HCl and human neoplasia has been reported, adequate epidemiological studies along these lines have not been conducted. Pregnancy Reproduction studies have been performed in rats at doses up to 50 mg/kg/day and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to Phenazopyridine HCl. There are, however, no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers No information is available on the appearance of Phenazopyridine HCl, or its metabolites in human milk."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Exceeding the recommended dose in patients with good renal function or administering the usual dose to patients with impaired renal function (common in elderly patients) may lead to increased serum levels and toxic reactions. Methemoglobinemia generally follows a massive, acute overdose. Methylene blue, 1 to 2 mg/kg/body weight intravenously or ascorbic acid 100 to 200 mg given orally should cause prompt reduction of the methemoglobinemia and disappearance of the cyanosis which is an aid in diagnosis. Oxidative Heinz body hemolytic anemia may also occur, and \u201cbite cells\u201d (degmacytes) may be present in a chronic overdosage situation. Red blood cell G-6-PD deficiency may predispose to hemolysis. Renal and hepatic impairment and occasional failure, usually due to hypersensitivity, may also occur."
