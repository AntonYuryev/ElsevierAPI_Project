      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Angioedema : Promptly discontinue fesoterodine fumarate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) Urinary Retention: Fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.2) Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility: Fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. (5.3) Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma: Use fesoterodine fumarate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.4) Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with fesoterodine fumarate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. (5.5) Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms: Use fesoterodine fumarate with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine fumarate. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or any of its ingredients [see Contraindications (4) ] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)] . The use of fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ] . Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Urinary Retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most frequently reported adverse events with fesoterodine fumarate in adult patients with OAB (\u22654%) were: dry mouth (placebo, 7%; fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, 19%; fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, 35%) and constipation (placebo, 2%; fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, 4%; fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, 6%). (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Amneal Pharmaceuticals at 1-877-835-5472 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.\u2019s TOVIAZ \u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) extended-release tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2,859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2,288 were treated with fesoterodine fumarate. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8- or 12-weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate in these trials. A total of 1,964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12-weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases).

Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations Central nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders: Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, pruritus"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Co-administration of fesoterodine fumarate with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . In a study in adults, co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by co-administration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.\u2019s TOVIAZ \u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) extended-release tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by co-administration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate and laboratory tests have not been studied."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively, the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data ) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.\u2019s TOVIAZ \u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) extended-release tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies. However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR < 30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] .

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg Parameter EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.90 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t 1/2 (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation; C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t 1/2 = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52.0 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ] . Gender Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR < 30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ] . CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by co-administration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during co-administration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study co-administering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the co-administration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by co-administration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1% to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11% to 13% [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ] . Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8% and 6% for the co-administration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions (7.7) ] .

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity No evidence of drug-related carcinogenicity was found in 24-month studies with oral administration to mice and rats. The highest tolerated doses in mice (females 45 to 60 mg/kg/day, males 30 to 45 mg/kg/day) correspond to 11 to 19 times (females) and 4 to 9 times (males) the estimated human AUC values reached with fesoterodine 8 mg, which is the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD). In rats, the highest tolerated dose (45 to 60 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 3 to 8 times (females) and 3 to 14 times (males) the estimated human AUC at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Fesoterodine was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames tests, chromosome aberration tests) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility Fesoterodine had no effect on male reproductive function or fertility at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day in mice. At 45 mg/kg/day, a lower number of corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable fetuses was observed in female mice administered fesoterodine for 2-weeks prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation. The maternal No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) and the NOEL for effects on reproduction and early embryonic development were both 15 mg/kg/day. At the NOEL, the systemic exposure, based on AUC, was 0.6 to 1.5 times higher in mice than in humans at the MRHD, whereas based on peak plasma concentrations, the exposure in mice was 5 to 9 times higher."

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema : Promptly discontinue fesoterodine fumarate and provide appropriate therapy. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Urinary Retention : Fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. ( 5.2 ) \u2022 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility : Fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma : Use fesoterodine fumarate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with fesoterodine fumarate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms : Use Fesoterodine fumarate with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate or any of its ingredients [see Contraindications (4)] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine fumarate should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. The use of fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4)] . Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. 5.5 Central Nervous Systems Effects Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: \u2022 Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] \u2022 Urinary Retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)] \u2022 Decreased Gastointestinal Motility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)] \u2022 Most frequently reported adverse events with fesoterodine fumarate in adult patients with OAB (\u22654%) were: dry mouth (placebo, 7%; fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, 19%; fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, 35%) and constipation (placebo, 2%; fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, 4%; fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, 6%). ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Most frequently reported adverse reactions with fesoterodine fumarate in pediatric patients (\u22652%) with NDO were: diarrhea, urinary tract infection (UTI), dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2,859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2,288 were treated with fesoterodine fumarate. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8-or 12-weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate in these trials. A total of 1,964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12-weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases). Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate was evaluated in a total of 131 pediatric patients with NDO. Patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg orally once daily in two clinical trials (Studies 3 and 4). Study 3 was a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with NDO from 6 years to 17 years of age and weighing greater than 25 kg. This study consisted of a 12-week efficacy phase, in which 84 patients received fesoterodine fumarate, followed by a 12-week safety extension phase, in which 103 patients received fesoterodine fumarate. Of the 103 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate in the safety extension phase, 67 continued fesoterodine fumarate from the efficacy phase and 36 switched from an active comparator in the efficacy phase to fesoterodine fumarate in the safety extension phase. Study 4 (N=11) was an 8-week, Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study in pediatric patients with NDO from 8 years to 17 years of age. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased and headache. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than or equal to 2% in either treatment group in the Study 3 efficacy phase. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of Patients With NDO Aged 6 Years to 17 Years in the 12-Week Efficacy Phase of Study 3 Preferred term Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg (N=42) % Fesoterodine Fumarate 8 mg (N=42) % Diarrhea 11.9 7.1 Urinary tract infection 9.5 2.4 Dry mouth 7.1 9.5 Constipation 7.1 7.1 Abdominal pain \u2020 7.1 4.8 Nausea 4.8 2.4 Weight increased 4.8 0 Headache 4.8 7.1 \u2020 Includes abdominal pain and abdominal pain upper Ophthalmological Adverse Reactions Ophthalmological adverse reactions, including myopia, accommodation disorder and blurred vision, were reported in 8 of 131 (6.1%) pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg in Study 3 (both efficacy and safety extension phases) and Study 4. The ophthalmological adverse reactions did not result in discontinuation of fesoterodine fumarate in any patient. Increases in Heart Rate Increases in heart rate were reported in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg in Study 3. The mean heart data are described in Table 6. Table 6: Mean Baseline and Mean Changes From Baseline in Heart Rate in Pediatric Patients Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 Study visit Mean heart rate in beats per minute 1 (mean change from baseline) Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine Fumarate 8 mg Baseline 88.6 84.2 Week 4 93.8 (+5.2) 94 (+9.8) Week 12 94.8 (+6.2) 94 (+9.8) Week 24 90.4 (+1.8) 90.8 (+6.5) 1 Heart rate expressed as the mean of the baseline measurement and the mean at each study visit and mean changes from baseline at each study visit by original treatment group in patients with complete follow-up at all study visits. The proportion of patients with heart rates greater than the 99 th percentile for age also increased from baseline in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg in Study 3. These data are described in Table 7. Table 7: Proportion of Pediatric Patients With Heart Rate Greater Than the 99 th Percentile for Age and Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 Study visit Proportion of patients with heart rate >99 th percentile for age Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine Fumarate 8 mg Baseline 2.4% 2.4% Week 4 8.1% 12.2% Week 12* 7.5% 11.5% Week 24 3.3% 2.7% * Week 12 comprises patients who received fesoterodine fumarate for 12 weeks after being originally randomized to fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg and patients originally randomized to active comparator and subsequently transitioned to fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg for 12 weeks. Increases from baseline in the proportion of patients with a heart rate greater than the 99 th percentile for age were most pronounced in patients less than 12 years of age who received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. Increases in heart rate in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg in Study 3 were not associated with clinical symptoms and did not result in discontinuation of therapy with fesoterodine fumarate. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fesoterodine fumarate. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders : Palpitations Central nervous system disorders : Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders : Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions : Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Urticaria, pruritus"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. The fesoterodine fumarate dose in pediatric patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is recommended to be reduced to 4 mg once daily in patients >35 kg and is not recommended in patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate and laboratory tests have not been studied."

    "use_in_specific_populations": [
      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open-label trial with an initial 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies. However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3)] . The recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate in pediatric patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) is 4 mg once daily and fesoterodine fumarate is not recommend in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). In pediatric patients weighing greater than 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the recommended starting dosage of fesoterodine fumarate is 4 mg orally once daily, with increase to the recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg orally once daily, and in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) the recommended dose is 4 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore, fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open-label trial with an initial 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine Fumarate 8 mg Parameter EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.9 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t \u00bd (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation; C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The T max and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] . CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4%, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8% and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3% with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions (7.7)]."

After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine Fumarate 8 mg Parameter EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.9 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t \u00bd (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation; C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The T max and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9. Table 9: Summary of Geometric Mean [%CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After Steady-State Dosing of Fesoterodine in Pediatric Patients with NDO, ages 6 to 17 years Weighing Greater Than 25 kg Dosage N C max,ss (ng/mL) AUC tau,ss (ng*h/mL) 4 mg once daily 32 4.88 (48.2) 59.1 (51.7) 8 mg once daily 39 8.47 (41.6) 103 (46.2) CV = coefficient of variation; C max,ss = steady-state maximum plasma concentration, AUC tau,ss = steady-state area under the concentration time curve over the 24-hour dosing interval, N = number of patients with PK data Gend er Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] . CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4%, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8% and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3% with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions (7.7)]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22656-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12-week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate are reported in Table 10.

In Study 2, the number of these patients was 205, 228, and 218, respectively. Figures 1 to 4: The following figures show change from baseline over time in number of micturitions and urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h in the two studies. A reduction in number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours was observed for both doses as compared to placebo as early as two weeks after starting fesoterodine fumarate therapy. fesoterodine-figure1.jpg fesoterodine-figure2.jpg fesoterodine-figure3.jpg fesoterodine-figure4.jpg 14.2 Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate was evaluated in Study 3 (NCT01557244), a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study consisting of a 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age. Two cohorts were studied. Cohort 1 (patients weighing greater than 25 kg) received a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg tablets orally once daily, or once daily. In the safety extension phase, patients randomized to the active comparator were switched to fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg once daily. For study inclusion, patients were required to have stable neurological disease and clinically or urodynamically-demonstrated NDO. Cohort 2 patients weighing less than 25 kg received an investigational fesoterodine formulation. During the 12-week efficacy phase, 124 patients (69 males and 55 females) were randomized to receive fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg (N=42), fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg (N=42), or active comparator (N=40) orally once daily. The majority of patients were Caucasian (52%) or Asian (44%) with a mean age of 11 years (range 6 years to 17 years) and a mean weight of 42.8 kg (range 25.1 to 96 kg). Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12. Treatment with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for pediatric patients, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg daily than for fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg daily. Results for the primary endpoint MCBC are reported in Table 11.

    ],
    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Angioedema : Promptly discontinue fesoterodine fumarate and provide appropriate therapy. (5.1) \u2022 Urinary Retention : Fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction because of the risk of urinary retention. (5.2) \u2022 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility : Fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended for use in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. (5.3) \u2022 Worsening of Narrow Angle Glaucoma : Use fesoterodine fumarate with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. (5.4) \u2022 Central Nervous System Effects : Somnolence has been reported with fesoterodine fumarate. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. (5.5) \u2022 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms : Use Fesoterodine fumarate with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. (5.6) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine. In some cases angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate or any of its ingredients [see Contraindications (4)] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine fumarate should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients with Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4)]. The use of fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate is contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4)] . Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. 5.5 Central Nervous Systems Effects Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2,859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2,288 were treated with fesoterodine fumarate. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8-or 12-weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate in these trials. A total of 1,964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12-weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.\u2019s TOVIAZ \u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) extended-release tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate and laboratory tests have not been studied."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.\u2019s TOVIAZ \u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) extended-release tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall differences in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies. However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and Adverse Reactions (6)]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.\u2019s TOVIAZ \u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) extended-release tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.\u2019s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that information. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore, fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] ."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology : The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were approximately 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption: After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of geometric mean [CV] pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor CYP2D6 metabolizers Fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg Parameter EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.9 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t \u00bd (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation; C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food: There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Distribution: Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism: After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism: A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion: Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Gender: Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race: The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment: In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450: At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] . CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8), and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . CYP3A4 Inducers: Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors: The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Oral Contraceptives : Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]. Warfarin: In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4%, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8% and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3% with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions (7.7)].

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology : The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were approximately 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group."

Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients: Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Gender: Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively.

The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race: The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively.

Renal Impairment: In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6), Warnings and Precautions (5.7), and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . Hepatic Impairment: In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7)]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450: At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7.5)] . CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.8), and Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . CYP3A4 Inducers: Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.3)]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors: The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4)]. Oral Contraceptives : Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions (7.6)]. Warfarin: In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4%, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8% and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3% with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions (7.7)].

In rats, the highest tolerated dose (45 to 60 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 3 to 8 times (females) and 3 to 14 times (males) the estimated human AUC at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Fesoterodine was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames tests, chromosome aberration tests) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility Fesoterodine had no effect on male reproductive function or fertility at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day in mice. At 45 mg/kg/day, a lower number of corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable fetuses was observed in female mice administered fesoterodine for 2-weeks prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation. The maternal No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) and the NOEL for effects on reproduction and early embryonic development were both 15 mg/kg/day. At the NOEL, the systemic exposure, based on AUC, was 0.6 to 1.5 times higher in mice than in humans at the MRHD, whereas based on peak plasma concentrations, the exposure in mice was 5 to 9 times higher."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22656-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12-week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate are reported in Table 10.

Angioedema Inform patients and/or their caregivers that fesoterodine fumarate may cause angioedema, which could result in life-threatening airway obstruction. Advise patients and/or their caregivers to promptly discontinue fesoterodine fumarate and seek immediate medical attention if they experience edema of the lips, tongue or laryngopharynx, or difficulty breathing. Antimuscarinic Effects Inform patients that fesoterodine fumarate, like other antimuscarinic agents, may produce clinically significant adverse effects related to antimuscarinic pharmacological activity including constipation and urinary retention. Fesoterodine fumarate, like other antimuscarinics, may be associated with blurred vision, therefore, patients should be advised to exercise caution in decisions to engage in potentially dangerous activities until the drug\u2019s effects on the patient have been determined. Heat prostration (due to decreased sweating) can occur when fesoterodine fumarate, like other antimuscarinic drugs, is used in a hot environment. Alcohol Patients should also be informed that alcohol may enhance the drowsiness caused by fesoterodine fumarate, like other anticholinergic agents."

( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets . In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or any of its ingredients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine fumarate should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. The use of Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma.. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Urinary Retention [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Most frequently reported adverse events with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in adult patients with OAB (\u22654%) were: dry mouth (placebo, 7%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, 19%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, 35%) and constipation (placebo, 2%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, 4%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, 6%). ( 6.1 ) Most frequently reported adverse reactions with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (\u22652%) with NDO were: diarrhea, urinary tract infection (UTI), dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased, and headache. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2,859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2,288 were treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumerate 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8- or 12- weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in these trials. A total of 1,964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate 4mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases). Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 131 pediatric patients with NDO. Patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily in two clinical trials (Studies 3 and 4). Study 3 was a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with NDO from 6 years to 17 years of age and weighing greater than 25 kg. This study consisted of a 12-week efficacy phase, in which 84 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, followed by a 12-week safety extension phase, in which 103 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of the 103 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase, 67 continued fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets from the efficacy phase and 36 switched from an active comparator in the efficacy phase to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase. Study 4 (N=11) was an 8-week, Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study in pediatric patients with NDO from 8 years to 17 years of age. 7 Reference ID: 5337448 The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased and headache. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than or equal to 2% in either treatment group in the Study 3 efficacy phase.

The ophthalmological adverse reactions did not result in discontinuation of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in any patient. Increases in Heart Rate Increases in heart rate were reported in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. The mean heart data are described in Table 6. Table 6: Mean Baseline and Mean Changes From Baseline in Heart Rate in Pediatric Patients Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 Study visit Mean heart rate in beats per minute1 (mean change from baseline) fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg Baseline 88.6 84.2 Week 4 93.8 (+5.2) 94.0 (+9.8) Week 12 94.8 (+6.2) 94.0 (+9.8) Week 24 90.4 (+1.8) 90.8 (+6.5) 1 Heart rate expressed as the mean of the baseline measurement and the mean at each study visit and mean changes from baseline at each study visit by original treatment group in patients with complete follow-up at all study visits. The proportion of patients with heart rates greater than the 99 th percentile for age also increased from baseline in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. These data are described in Table 7.

Increases from baseline in the proportion of patients with a heart rate greater than the 99th percentile for age were most pronounced in patients less than 12 years of age who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. Increases in heart rate in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 were not associated with clinical symptoms and did not result in discontinuation of therapy with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders : Palpitations Central nervous system disorders : Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders : Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions : Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Urticaria, pruritus"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. The fesoterodine fumarate extended-release dose in pediatric patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is recommended to be reduced to 4 mg once daily in patients >35 kg and is not recommended in patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine extended-release tablets 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate and laboratory tests have not been studied"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine fumarate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open-label trial with an initial 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies; However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness ( 8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. The recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) is 4 mg once daily and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is not recommend in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). In pediatric patients weighing greater than 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the recommended starting dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is 4 mg orally once daily, with increase to the recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily, and in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) the recommended dose is 4 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Parameter Fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.90 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t \u00bd (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The Tmax and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively . The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3)]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )], and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period crossover study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 \u2013 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [ see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the co-administration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anti-coagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 ) ]."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Parameter Fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.90 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t \u00bd (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4.

The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The Tmax and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively . The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3)]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )], and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period crossover study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 \u2013 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [ see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the co-administration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anti-coagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 ) ]."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity No evidence of drug-related carcinogenicity was found in 24 month studies with oral administration to mice and rats. The highest tolerated doses in mice (females 45 to 60 mg/kg/day, males 30 to 45 mg/kg/day) correspond to 11 to 19 times (females) and 4 to 9 times (males) the estimated human AUC values reached with fesoterodine 8 mg, which is the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD). In rats, the highest tolerated dose (45 to 60 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 3 to 8 times (females) and 3 to 14 times (males) the estimated human AUC at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Fesoterodine was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames tests, chromosome aberration tests) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility Fesoterodine had no effect on male reproductive function or fertility at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day in mice. At 45 mg/kg/day, a lower number of corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable fetuses was observed in female mice administered fesoterodine for 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation. The maternal No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) and the NOEL for effects on reproduction and early embryonic development were both 15 mg/kg/day. At the NOEL, the systemic exposure, based on AUC, was 0.6 to 1.5 times higher in mice than in humans at the MRHD, whereas based on peak plasma concentrations, the exposure in mice was 5 to 9 times higher."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 6-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12 week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate are reported in Table 10.

In Study 2, the number of these patients was 205, 228, and 218, respectively. Figures 1-4: The following figures show change from baseline over time in number of micturitions and urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h in the two studies. A reduction in number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours was observed for both doses as compared to placebo as early as two weeks after starting fesoterodine fumarate therapy. 14.2 Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Study 3 (NCT01557244), a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study consisting of a 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age. Two cohorts were studied. Cohort 1 (patients weighing greater than 25 kg) received a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg tablets orally once daily, or once daily. In the safety extension phase, patients randomized to the active comparator were switched to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg once daily. For study inclusion, patients were required to have stable neurological disease and clinically or urodynamically-demonstrated NDO. Cohort 2 patients weighing less than 25 kg received an investigational fesoterodine formulation. During the 12-week efficacy phase, 124 patients (69 males and 55 females) were randomized to receive fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg (N=42), fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg (N=42), or active comparator (N=40) orally once daily. The majority of patients were Caucasian (52%) or Asian (44%) with a mean age of 11 years (range 6 years to 17 years) and a mean weight of 42.8 kg (range 25.1 to 96.0 kg). Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12. Treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for pediatric patients, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg daily than for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg daily. Results for the primary endpoint MCBC are reported in Table 11.

( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or any of its ingredients [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients with Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )]. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] Urinary Retention [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] Most frequently reported adverse events with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in adult patients with OAB (\u22654%) were: dry mouth (placebo, 7%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, 4 mg, 19%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, 8 mg, 35%) and constipation (placebo, 2%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, 4 mg, 4%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, 8 mg, 6%). ( 6.1 ) Most frequently reported adverse reactions with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (\u22652%) with NDO were: diarrhea, urinary tract infection (UTI), dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. at 1- 877-993-8779 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2,859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2,288 were treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8 weeks or 12 weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10 weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in these trials. A total of 1,964 patients participated in two 12 week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12 week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases). Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 131 pediatric patients with NDO. Patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily in two clinical trials (Studies 3 and 4). Study 3 was a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with NDO from 6 years to 17 years of age and weighing greater than 25 kg. This study consisted of a 12 week efficacy phase, in which 84 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, followed by a 12 week safety extension phase, in which 103 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of the 103 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase, 67 continued fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets from the efficacy phase and 36 switched from an active comparator in the efficacy phase to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase. Study 4 (N=11) was an 8 week, Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study in pediatric patients with NDO from 8 years to 17 years of age. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased and headache. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than or equal to 2% in either treatment group in the Study 3 efficacy phase.

The ophthalmological adverse reactions did not result in discontinuation of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in any patient. Increases in Heart Rate Increases in heart rate were reported in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. The mean heart data are described in Table 6. Table 6 Mean Baseline and Mean Changes From Baseline in Heart Rate in Pediatric Patients Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 1 Heart rate expressed as the mean of the baseline measurement and the mean at each study visit and mean changes from baseline at each study visit by original treatment group in patients with complete follow-up at all study visits.

These data are described in Table 7. Table 7 Proportion of Pediatric Patients With Heart Rate Greater Than the 99 th Percentile for Age and Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 * Week 12 comprises patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for 12 weeks after being originally randomized to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg and patients originally randomized to active comparator and subsequently transitioned to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg for 12 weeks.

Increases in heart rate in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 were not associated with clinical symptoms and did not result in discontinuation of therapy with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations Central nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders: Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, pruritus"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. The fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets dose in pediatric patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is recommended to be reduced to 4 mg once daily in patients >35 kg and is not recommended in patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate and laboratory tests have not been studied."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre-and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open- label trial with an initial 12 week efficacy phase followed by a 12 week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies. However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3 )] . The recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) is 4 mg once daily and fesoterodine fumarate is not recommend in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). In pediatric patients weighing greater than 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the recommended starting dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is 4 mg orally once daily, with increase to the recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily, and in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) the recommended dose is 4 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4)] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] ."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre-and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring."

      "8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open- label trial with an initial 12 week efficacy phase followed by a 12 week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia's correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 years to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8 Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg Parameter EM (N=16) PM (N =8) EM (N =16) PM (N =8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.90 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t \u00bd (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation; C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The T max and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively . The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )] . Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4-and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ] . Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period crossover study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )] . Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the coadministration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following coadministration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )] ."

Table 8 Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of Fesoterodine Fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg Parameter EM (N=16) PM (N =8) EM (N =16) PM (N =8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.90 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t \u00bd (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation; C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )] . Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 )] . Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The T max and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9. Table 9 Summary of Geometric Mean [%CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After Steady-State Dosing of Fesoterodine in Pediatric Patients With NDO, Ages 6 to 17 Years Weighing Greater Than 25 kg CV = coefficient of variation; C max,ss = steady-state maximum plasma concentration, AUC tau,ss = steady-state area under the concentration time curve over the 24-hour dosing interval, N = number of patients with PK data Dosage N C max,ss (ng/mL) AUC tau,ss (ng*h/mL) 4 mg once daily 32 4.88 (48.2) 59.1 (51.7) 8 mg once daily 39 8.47 (41.6) 103 (46.2) Gender Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively . The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )] . Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )] . CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4-and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )] . CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )] . CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ] . Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period crossover study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )] . Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the coadministration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following coadministration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )] ."

The highest tolerated doses in mice (females 45 mg/kg/day to 60 mg/kg/day, males 30 mg/kg/day to 45 mg/kg/day) correspond to 11 times to 19 times (females) and 4 times to 9 times (males) the estimated human AUC values reached with fesoterodine 8 mg, which is the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD). In rats, the highest tolerated dose (45 mg/kg/day to 60 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 3 times to 8 times (females) and 3 times to 14 times (males) the estimated human AUC at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Fesoterodine was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames tests, chromosome aberration tests) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility Fesoterodine had no effect on male reproductive function or fertility at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day in mice. At 45 mg/kg/day, a lower number of corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable fetuses was observed in female mice administered fesoterodine for 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation. The maternal No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) and the NOEL for effects on reproduction and early embryonic development were both 15 mg/kg/day.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12 week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22656 months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3 day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 years to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12 week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate are reported in Table 10.

In Study 2, the number of these patients was 205, 228, and 218, respectively. Figures 1-4: The following figures show change from baseline over time in number of micturitions and urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h in the two studies.

Two cohorts were studied. Cohort 1 (patients weighing greater than 25 kg) received a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg tablets orally once daily, or once daily. In the safety extension phase, patients randomized to the active comparator were switched to fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg once daily. For study inclusion, patients were required to have stable neurological disease and clinically or urodynamically-demonstrated NDO. Cohort 2 patients weighing less than 25 kg received an investigational fesoterodine formulation. During the 12 week efficacy phase, 124 patients (69 males and 55 females) were randomized to receive fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg (N=42), fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg (N=42), or active comparator (N=40) orally once daily. The majority of patients were Caucasian (52%) or Asian (44%) with a mean age of 11 years (range 6 years to 17 years) and a mean weight of 42.8 kg (range 25.1 kg to 96 kg). Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12. Treatment with fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for pediatric patients, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg daily than for fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg daily. Results for the primary endpoint MCBC are reported in Table 11.

Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8-or 12-weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in these trials. A total of 1,964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open- label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12-weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases).

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.'s TOVIAZ \u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) Extended-Release Tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [ see Clinical Pharmacology(12.3) ]. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets and laboratory tests have not been studied."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD)of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.'s TOVIAZ\u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) Extended-Release Tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies. However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0-and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5-and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )] . Pediatric use information is approved for Pfizer Inc.'s TOVIAZ\u00ae (fesoterodine fumarate) Extended-Release Tablets. However, due to Pfizer Inc.'s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets contains fesoterodine fumarate. Fesoterodine is rapidly de-esterified to its active metabolite (R)-2-(3-diisopropylamino-1-phenylpropyl)-4-hydroxymethyl-phenol, or 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is a muscarinic receptor antagonist. Chemically, fesoterodine fumarate is designated as isobutyric acid 2-((R)-3-diisopropylammonium-1\u00ad phenylpropyl)-4-(hydroxymethyl) phenyl ester hydrogen fumarate. The empirical formula is C 30 H 41 NO 7 and its molecular weight is 527.66. The structural formula is: The asterisk (*) indicates the chiral carbon. Fesoterodine fumarate is a white to off-white powder, which is freely soluble in water. Each fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets contains either 4 mg or 8mg of fesoterodine fumarate and the following inactive ingredients: glyceryl behenate, hypromellose, FD&C Blue #2/Indigo carmine aluminum lake, soya lecithin, microcrystalline cellulose, polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol, talc, and titanium dioxide. fesoterodine-str"

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo- subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Abs o r p tio n After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple- dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8.

In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52.0 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1\u00b12.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Gender Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 ) ]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co\u00ad-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 ) ].

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo- subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group."

Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52.0 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1\u00b12.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Gender Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively [ see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 ) ]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co\u00ad-administration relative to warfarin alone.

The highest tolerated doses in mice (females 45 to 60 mg/kg/day, males 30 to 45 mg/kg/day) correspond to 11 to 19 times (females) and 4 to 9 times (males) the estimated human AUC values reached with fesoterodine 8 mg, which is the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD). In rats, the highest tolerated dose (45 to 60 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 3 to 8 times (females) and 3 to 14 times (males) the estimated human AUC at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Fesoterodine was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames tests, chromosome aberration tests) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility Fesoterodine had no effect on male reproductive function or fertility at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day in mice. At 45 mg/kg/day, a lower number of corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable fetuses was observed in female mice administered fesoterodine for 2-weeks prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation. The maternal No-Observed-Effect Level (NOEL) and the NOEL for effects on reproduction and early embryonic development were both 15 mg/kg/day. At the NOEL, the systemic exposure, based on AUC, was 0.6 to 1.5 times higher in mice than in humans at the MRHD, whereas based on peak plasma concentrations, the exposure in mice was 5 to 9 times higher."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 6-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12-week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are reported in Table 10.

( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or any of its ingredients [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: \u00b7 Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] \u00b7 Urinary Retention [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] \u00b7 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] \u2022 Most frequently reported adverse events with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in adult patients with OAB (\u22654%) were: dry mouth (placebo, 7%; fesoterodine 4 mg, 19%; fesoterodine 8 mg, 35%) and constipation (placebo, 2%; fesoterodine 4 mg, 4%; fesoterodine tablets 8 mg, 6%). ( 6.1 ) \u2022 Most frequently reported adverse reactions with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (\u22652%) with NDO were: diarrhea, urinary tract infection (UTI), dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact NorthStar Rx LLC at 1-800-206-7821 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2288 were treated with fesoterodine. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8- or 12-weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in these trials. A total of 1964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12-weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases). Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 131 pediatric patients with NDO. Patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily in two clinical trials (Studies 3 and 4). Study 3 was a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with NDO from 6 years to 17 years of age and weighing greater than 25 kg. This study consisted of a 12-week efficacy phase, in which 84 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, followed by a 12-week safety extension phase, in which 103 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of the 103 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase, 67 continued fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets from the efficacy phase and 36 switched from an active comparator in the efficacy phase to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase. Study 4 (N=11) was an 8-week, Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study in pediatric patients with NDO from 8 years to 17 years of age. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased and headache. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than or equal to 2% in either treatment group in the Study 3 efficacy phase. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of Patients With NDO Aged 6 Years to 17 Years in the 12-Week Efficacy Phase of Study 3 Preferred term Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg (N=42) % Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg (N=42) % Diarrhea 11.9 7.1 Urinary tract infection 9.5 2.4 Dry mouth 7.1 9.5 Constipation 7.1 7.1 Abdominal pain \u2020 7.1 4.8 Nausea 4.8 2.4 Weight increased 4.8 0 Headache 4.8 7.1 \u2020 Includes abdominal pain and abdominal pain upper Ophthalmological Adverse Reactions Ophthalmological adverse reactions, including myopia, accommodation disorder and blurred vision, were reported in 8 of 131 (6.1%) pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 (both efficacy and safety extension phases) and Study 4. The ophthalmological adverse reactions did not result in discontinuation of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in any patient. Increases in Heart Rate Increases in heart rate were reported in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. The mean heart data are described in Table 6. Table 6: Mean Baseline and Mean Changes From Baseline in Heart Rate in Pediatric Patients Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 Study visit Mean heart rate in beats per minute 1 (mean change from baseline) Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg Baseline 88.6 84.2 Week 4 93.8 (+5.2) 94.0 (+9.8) Week 12 94.8 (+6.2) 94.0 (+9.8) Week 24 90.4 (+1.8) 90.8 (+6.5) 1 Heart rate expressed as the mean of the baseline measurement and the mean at each study visit and mean changes from baseline at each study visit by original treatment group in patients with complete follow-up at all study visits. The proportion of patients with heart rates greater than the 99 th percentile for age also increased from baseline in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. These data are described in Table 7.

Increases from baseline in the proportion of patients with a heart rate greater than the 99 th percentile for age were most pronounced in patients less than 12 years of age who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. Increases in heart rate in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 were not associated with clinical symptoms and did not result in discontinuation of therapy with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations Central nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders: Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, pruritus"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. The fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets dose in pediatric patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is recommended to be reduced to 4 mg once daily in patients >35 kg and is not recommended in patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets and laboratory tests have not been studied."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for fesoterodine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open-label trial with an initial 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies. However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. The recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) is 4 mg once daily and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is not recommend in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). In pediatric patients weighing greater than 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the recommended starting dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is 4 mg orally once daily, with increase to the recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily, and in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) the recommended dose is 4 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet is not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia's correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of Fesoterodine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg Parameter EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.90 [39%] AUC 0-tz 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] (ng*h/mL) t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t 1/2 (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation; C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0 to tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52.0 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The T max and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR < 30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5- fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5-and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )]."

The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9. Table 9: Summary of Geometric Mean [%CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After Steady-State Dosing of Fesoterodine in Pediatric Patients With NDO, Ages 6 to 17 Years Weighing Greater Than 25 kg Dosage N C max,ss (ng/mL) AUC tau,ss (ng*h/mL) 4 mg once daily 32 4.88 (48.2) 59.1 (51.7) 8 mg once daily 39 8.47 (41.6) 103 (46.2) CV = coefficient of variation; C max ,ss = steady-state maximum plasma concentration, AUCtau,ss = steady-state area under the concentration time curve over the 24-hour dosing interval, N = number of patients with PK data Gender Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR < 30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5- fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5-and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22656-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12-week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are reported in Table 10.

In Study 2, the number of these patients was 205, 228, and 218, respectively. Figures 1 to 4: The following figures show change from baseline over time in number of micturitions and urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h in the two studies. A reduction in number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours was observed for both doses as compared to placebo as early as two weeks after starting fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets therapy. figure-1 figure-2 figure-3 figure-4 14.2 Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Study 3 (NCT01557244), a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study consisting of a 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age. Two cohorts were studied. Cohort 1 (patients weighing greater than 25 kg) received a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg tablets orally once daily, or once daily. In the safety extension phase, patients randomized to the active comparator were switched to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg once daily. For study inclusion, patients were required to have stable neurological disease and clinically or urodynamically-demonstrated NDO. Cohort 2 patients weighing less than 25 kg received an investigational fesoterodine formulation. During the 12-week efficacy phase, 124 patients (69 males and 55 females) were randomized to receive fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg (N=42), fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg (N=42), or active comparator (N=40) orally once daily. The majority of patients were Caucasian (52%) or Asian (44%) with a mean age of 11 years (range 6 years to 17 years) and a mean weight of 42.8 kg (range 25.1 to 96.0 kg). Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12. Treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for pediatric patients, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg daily than for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg daily. Results for the primary endpoint MCBC are reported in Table 11.

( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or any of its ingredients [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet is contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications ( 4 )] . Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

( 6.1 ) \u2022 Most frequently reported adverse reactions with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (\u22652%) with NDO were: diarrhea, urinary tract infection (UTI), dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Annora Pharma Private Limited at 1-866-495-1995 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2288 were treated with fesoterodine. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8- or 12-weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in these trials. A total of 1964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12-weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases). Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 131 pediatric patients with NDO. Patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily in two clinical trials (Studies 3 and 4). Study 3 was a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with NDO from 6 years to 17 years of age and weighing greater than 25 kg. This study consisted of a 12-week efficacy phase, in which 84 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, followed by a 12-week safety extension phase, in which 103 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of the 103 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase, 67 continued fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets from the efficacy phase and 36 switched from an active comparator in the efficacy phase to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase. Study 4 (N=11) was an 8-week, Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study in pediatric patients with NDO from 8 years to 17 years of age. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased and headache. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than or equal to 2% in either treatment group in the Study 3 efficacy phase.

The ophthalmological adverse reactions did not result in discontinuation of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in any patient. Increases in Heart Rate Increases in heart rate were reported in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. The mean heart data are described in Table 6. Table 6: Mean Baseline and Mean Changes From Baseline in Heart Rate in Pediatric Patients Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 Study visit Mean heart rate in beats per minute 1 (mean change from baseline) Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg Baseline 88.6 84.2 Week 4 93.8 (+5.2) 94.0 (+9.8) Week 12 94.8 (+6.2) 94.0 (+9.8) Week 24 90.4 (+1.8) 90.8 (+6.5) 1 Heart rate expressed as the mean of the baseline measurement and the mean at each study visit and mean changes from baseline at each study visit by original treatment group in patients with complete follow-up at all study visits. The proportion of patients with heart rates greater than the 99 th percentile for age also increased from baseline in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. These data are described in Table 7. Table 7: Proportion of Pediatric Patients With Heart Rate Greater Than the 99 th Percentile for Age and Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 Study visit Proportion of patients with heart rate >99th percentile for age Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg Baseline 2.4% 2.4% Week 4 8.1% 12.2% Week 12 \u204e 7.5% 11.5% Week 24 3.3% 2.7% * Week 12 comprises patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for 12 weeks after being originally randomized to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg and patients originally randomized to active comparator and subsequently transitioned to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg for 12 weeks. Increases from baseline in the proportion of patients with a heart rate greater than the 99 th percentile for age were most pronounced in patients less than 12 years of age who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. Increases in heart rate in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 were not associated with clinical symptoms and did not result in discontinuation of therapy with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations Central nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders: Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, pruritus"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. The fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets dose in pediatric patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is recommended to be reduced to 4 mg once daily in patients >35 kg and is not recommended in patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets and laboratory tests have not been studied."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for fesoterodine and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open-label trial with an initial 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )] . Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) and Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )] . Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies. However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. The recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) is 4 mg once daily and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is not recommend in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). In pediatric patients weighing greater than 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the recommended starting dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is 4 mg orally once daily, with increase to the recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily, and in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) the recommended dose is 4 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablet is not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia's correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8.

In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52.0 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The T max and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR < 30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5- fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5-and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )]."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia's correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of Fesoterodine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg Parameter EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.90 [39%] AUC 0-tz 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] (ng*h/mL) t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t 1/2 (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation; C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0 to tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52.0 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5)]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The T max and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56.0 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73.0 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR < 30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3 )]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 )]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.0- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5- fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5-and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 ) and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3 )]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 )]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 )]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions ( 7.6 )]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 )]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22656-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12-week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are reported in Table 10.

In Study 2, the number of these patients was 205, 228, and 218, respectively. Figures 1 to 4: The following figures show change from baseline over time in number of micturitions and urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h in the two studies. A reduction in number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours was observed for both doses as compared to placebo as early as two weeks after starting fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets therapy. figure-1 figure-2 figure-3 figure-4 14.2 Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Study 3 (NCT01557244), a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study consisting of a 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age. Two cohorts were studied. Cohort 1 (patients weighing greater than 25 kg) received a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg tablets orally once daily, or once daily. In the safety extension phase, patients randomized to the active comparator were switched to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg once daily. For study inclusion, patients were required to have stable neurological disease and clinically or urodynamically-demonstrated NDO. Cohort 2 patients weighing less than 25 kg received an investigational fesoterodine formulation. During the 12-week efficacy phase, 124 patients (69 males and 55 females) were randomized to receive fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg (N=42), fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg (N=42), or active comparator (N=40) orally once daily. The majority of patients were Caucasian (52%) or Asian (44%) with a mean age of 11 years (range 6 years to 17 years) and a mean weight of 42.8 kg (range 25.1 to 96.0 kg). Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12. Treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for pediatric patients, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg daily than for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg daily. Results for the primary endpoint MCBC are reported in Table 11. Table 11: Mean Baseline and Change From Baseline to Week 12 for Maximum Cystometric Bladder Capacity (mL) in Pediatric NDO Patients Receiving Fesoterodine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets 4 mg or Fesoterodine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets 8 mg and Weighing More Than 25 kg in Study 3 Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg N 41 41 Baseline 195.1 173.3 Change from baseline (95% CI) \u2020 58.1 (28.8, 87.4) 83.4 (54.2, 112.5) CI = confidence interval Baseline is defined as the last available measurement prior to the start of treatment.

( 5.5 ) Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms : Use fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis. ( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or any of its ingredients [see Contraindications (4) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [see Contraindications (4) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications (4) ]. The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [see Contraindications (4) ]. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets affect them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Angioedema [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] Urinary Retention [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] Most frequently reported adverse events with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in adult patients with OAB (\u22654%) were: dry mouth (placebo, 7%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, 19%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, 35%) and constipation (placebo, 2%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, 4%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, 6%). ( 6.1 ) Most frequently reported adverse reactions with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (\u22652%) with NDO were: diarrhea, urinary tract infection (UTI), dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased, and headache. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets were evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2288 were treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8- or 12-weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in these trials. A total of 1964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12-weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases). Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 131 pediatric patients with NDO. Patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily in two clinical trials (Studies 3 and 4). Study 3 was a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with NDO from 6 years to 17 years of age and weighing greater than 25 kg. This study consisted of a 12-week efficacy phase, in which 84 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, followed by a 12-week safety extension phase, in which 103 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of the 103 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase, 67 continued fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets from the efficacy phase and 36 switched from an active comparator in the efficacy phase to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase. Study 4 (N=11) was an 8-week, Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study in pediatric patients with NDO from 8 years to 17 years of age. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased and headache. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than or equal to 2% in either treatment group in the Study 3 efficacy phase. Table 5: Adverse Reactions Reported in \u22652% of Patients With NDO Aged 6 Years to 17 Years in the 12-Week Efficacy Phase of Study 3 \u2020 Includes abdominal pain and abdominal pain upper Preferred term Fesoterodine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets 4 mg (N=42) % Fesoterodine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets 8 mg (N=42) % Diarrhea 11.9 7.1 Urinary tract infection 9.5 2.4 Dry mouth 7.1 9.5 Constipation 7.1 7.1 Abdominal pain \u2020 7.1 4.8 Nausea 4.8 2.4 Weight increased 4.8 0 Headache 4.8 7.1 Ophthalmological Adverse Reactions Ophthalmological adverse reactions, including myopia, accommodation disorder and blurred vision, were reported in 8 of 131 (6.1%) pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 (both efficacy and safety extension phases) and Study 4. The ophthalmological adverse reactions did not result in discontinuation of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in any patient. Increases in Heart Rate Increases in heart rate were reported in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. The mean heart data are described in Table 6. Table 6: Mean Baseline and Mean Changes From Baseline in Heart Rate in Pediatric Patients Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 Study visit Mean heart rate in beats per minute 1 (mean change from baseline) Fesoterodine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets 4 mg Fesoterodine Fumarate Extended-Release Tablets 8 mg Baseline 88.6 84.2 Week 4 93.8 (+5.2) 94.0 (+9.8) Week 12 94.8 (+6.2) 94.0 (+9.8) Week 24 90.4 (+1.8) 90.8 (+6.5) 1 Heart rate expressed as the mean of the baseline measurement and the mean at each study visit and mean changes from baseline at each study visit by original treatment group in patients with complete follow-up at all study visits. The proportion of patients with heart rates greater than the 99 th percentile for age also increased from baseline in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. These data are described in Table 7. Table 7: Proportion of Pediatric Patients With Heart Rate Greater Than the 99 th Percentile for Age and Weighing Greater Than 25 kg in Study 3 * Week 12 comprises patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for 12 weeks after being originally randomized to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg and patients originally randomized to active comparator and subsequently transitioned to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg for 12 weeks.

Increases in heart rate in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 were not associated with clinical symptoms and did not result in discontinuation of therapy with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders: Palpitations Central nervous system disorders: Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders: Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions: Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Urticaria, pruritus"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ] . The fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets dose in pediatric patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is recommended to be reduced to 4 mg once daily in patients >35 kg and is not recommended in patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) ]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets and laboratory tests have not been studied."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day, based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open-label trial with an initial 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ]. Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ]. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies. However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness (8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.3) ]. The recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) is 4 mg once daily and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is not recommend in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). In pediatric patients weighing greater than 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the recommended starting dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is 4 mg orally once daily, with increase to the recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily, and in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) the recommended dose is 4 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration (2.2, 2.4) ] . 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets were associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8.

In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [see Use in Specific Populations (8.5) ]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The T max and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) and Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [see Drug Interactions (7.5) ]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5-and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co\u00ad-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions (7.7) ]."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects."

      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets were associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration.

CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5-and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.2) and Dosage and Administration (2.2 , 2.3) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [see Drug Interactions (7.3) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively [see Drug Interactions (7.4) ] . Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period cross-over study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 to 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the coadministration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anticoagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co\u00ad-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [see Drug Interactions (7.7) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u22656-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12-week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are reported in Table 10.

In Study 2, the number of these patients was 205, 228, and 218, respectively. Figures 1 to 4: The following figures show change from baseline over time in number of micturitions and urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h in the two studies. A reduction in number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours was observed for both doses as compared to placebo as early as two weeks after starting fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets therapy.

Two cohorts were studied. Cohort 1 (patients weighing greater than 25 kg) received a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily, or once daily. In the safety extension phase, patients randomized to the active comparator were switched to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg once daily. For study inclusion, patients were required to have stable neurological disease and clinically or urodynamically-demonstrated NDO. Cohort 2 patients weighing less than 25 kg received an investigational fesoterodine formulation. During the 12-week efficacy phase, 124 patients (69 males and 55 females) were randomized to receive fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg (N=42), fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg (N=42), or active comparator (N=40) orally once daily. The majority of patients were Caucasian (52%) or Asian (44%) with a mean age of 11 years (range 6 years to 17 years) and a mean weight of 42.8 kg (range 25.1 to 96.0 kg). Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12. Treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for pediatric patients, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg daily than for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg daily. Results for the primary endpoint MCBC are reported in Table 11.

( 5.6 ) 5.1 Angioedema Angioedema of the face, lips, tongue, and/or larynx has been reported with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets . In some cases, angioedema occurred after the first dose; however, cases have been reported to occur hours after the first dose or after multiple doses. Angioedema associated with upper airway swelling may be life-threatening. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with a known or suspected hypersensitivity to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets or any of its ingredients [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. If involvement of the tongue, hypopharynx, or larynx occurs, fesoterodine fumarate should be promptly discontinued and appropriate therapy and/or measures to ensure a patent airway should be promptly provided. 5.2 Urinary Retention in Adult Patients With Bladder Outlet Obstruction The use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, like other antimuscarinic drugs, in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, including patients with urinary retention, may result in further urinary retention and kidney injury. The use of Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with clinically significant bladder outlet obstruction, and is contraindicated in patients with urinary retention [ see Contraindications ( 4 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ) ]. 5.3 Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are associated with decreased gastric motility. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with gastric retention [see Contraindications ( 4 ) ]. The use of Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are not recommended in patients with decreased gastrointestinal motility, such as those with severe constipation. 5.4 Worsening of Narrow-Angle Glaucoma Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets can worsen controlled narrow-angle glaucoma. Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with uncontrolled narrow-angle glaucoma [ see Contraindications (4) ]. Fesoterodine fumarate should be used with caution in patients being treated for narrow-angle glaucoma.. 5.5 Central Nervous System Effects Fesoterodine fumarate is associated with anticholinergic central nervous system (CNS) adverse reactions [ see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 )]. A variety of CNS anticholinergic effects have been reported, including headache, dizziness, and somnolence. Patients should be monitored for signs of anticholinergic CNS effects, particularly after beginning treatment or increasing the dose. Advise patients not to drive or operate heavy machinery until they know how fesoterodine fumarate affects them. If a patient experiences anticholinergic CNS effects, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered. 5.6 Worsening of Myasthenia Gravis Symptoms Fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets should be used with caution in patients with myasthenia gravis due to the risk of worsening of symptoms of the disease."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in labeling: Angioedema [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 ) ] Urinary Retention [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 ) ] Decreased Gastrointestinal Motility [ see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Most frequently reported adverse events with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in adult patients with OAB (\u22654%) were: dry mouth (placebo, 7%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, 19%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, 35%) and constipation (placebo, 2%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, 4%; fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, 6%). ( 6.1 ) Most frequently reported adverse reactions with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients (\u22652%) with NDO were: diarrhea, urinary tract infection (UTI), dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased, and headache. (6.1) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Dr. Reddy\u2019s Laboratories, Inc. at 1-888-375-3784 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Adult Overactive Bladder (OAB) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Phase 2 and 3 controlled trials in a total of 2,859 patients with overactive bladder, of which 2,288 were treated with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of this total, 782 received fesoterodine fumerate 4 mg/day, and 785 received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day with treatment periods of 8- or 12- weeks. Approximately 80% of these patients had greater than 10-weeks of exposure to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in these trials. A total of 1,964 patients participated in two 12-week, Phase 3 efficacy and safety studies and subsequent open-label extension studies. In these two studies combined, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg/day and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg/day. In Phase 2 and 3 placebo-controlled trials combined, the incidences of serious adverse events in patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg were 1.9%, 3.5%, and 2.9%, respectively. All serious adverse events were judged to be not related or unlikely to be related to study medication by the investigator, except for four patients receiving fesoterodine fumarate who reported one serious adverse reaction each: angina, chest pain, gastroenteritis, and QT prolongation on ECG. The most commonly reported adverse event in patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate was dry mouth. The incidence of dry mouth was higher in those taking 8 mg/day (35%) and in those taking 4 mg/day (19%), as compared to placebo (7%). Dry mouth led to discontinuation in 0.4%, 0.4%, and 0.8% of patients receiving placebo, fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg, and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg, respectively. For those patients who reported dry mouth, most had their first occurrence of the event within the first month of treatment. The second most commonly reported adverse event was constipation. The incidence of constipation was 2% in those taking placebo, 4% in those taking 4 mg/day, and 6% in those taking 8 mg/day. Table 4 lists adverse events, regardless of causality, that were reported in the combined Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled trials at an incidence greater than placebo and in 1% or more of patients treated with fesoterodine fumarate 4mg or 8 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks.

In all open-label trials combined, 857, 701, 529, and 105 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for at least 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years, respectively. The adverse events observed during long-term, open-label studies were similar to those observed in the 12-week, placebo-controlled studies, and included dry mouth, constipation, dry eyes, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain. Similar to the controlled studies, most adverse events of dry mouth and constipation were mild to moderate in intensity. Serious adverse events, judged to be at least possibly related to study medication by the investigator and reported more than once during the open-label treatment period of up to 3 years, included urinary retention (3 cases), diverticulitis (3 cases), constipation (2 cases), irritable bowel syndrome (2 cases), and electrocardiogram QT corrected interval prolongation (2 cases). Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity (NDO) The safety of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in a total of 131 pediatric patients with NDO. Patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily in two clinical trials (Studies 3 and 4). Study 3 was a Phase 3 study in pediatric patients with NDO from 6 years to 17 years of age and weighing greater than 25 kg. This study consisted of a 12-week efficacy phase, in which 84 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, followed by a 12-week safety extension phase, in which 103 patients received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Of the 103 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase, 67 continued fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets from the efficacy phase and 36 switched from an active comparator in the efficacy phase to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in the safety extension phase. Study 4 (N=11) was an 8-week, Phase 2 pharmacokinetic (PK) and safety study in pediatric patients with NDO from 8 years to 17 years of age. 7 Reference ID: 5337448 The most commonly reported adverse reactions in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increased and headache. Table 5 lists the adverse reactions reported at an incidence greater than or equal to 2% in either treatment group in the Study 3 efficacy phase.

The ophthalmological adverse reactions did not result in discontinuation of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in any patient. Increases in Heart Rate Increases in heart rate were reported in pediatric patients with NDO who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3. The mean heart data are described in Table 6.

Increases from baseline in the proportion of patients with a heart rate greater than the 99th percentile for age were most pronounced in patients less than 12 years of age who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. Increases in heart rate in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg in Study 3 were not associated with clinical symptoms and did not result in discontinuation of therapy with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Cardiac disorders : Palpitations Central nervous system disorders : Dizziness, headache, somnolence Eye disorders : Blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders: Hypoaesthesia oral General disorders and administrative site conditions : Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema with airway obstruction, face edema Psychiatric disorders: Confusional state Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders : Urticaria, pruritus"

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS 7.1 Antimuscarinic Drugs Coadministration of fesoterodine fumarate with other antimuscarinic agents that produce dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, and other anticholinergic pharmacological effects may increase the frequency and/or severity of such effects. Anticholinergic agents may potentially alter the absorption of some concomitantly administered drugs due to anticholinergic effects on gastrointestinal motility. 7.2 CYP3A4 Inhibitors Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, and clarithromycin [see Dosage and Administration (2.5)]. The fesoterodine fumarate extended-release dose in pediatric patients taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is recommended to be reduced to 4 mg once daily in patients >35 kg and is not recommended in patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.5 )]. In a study in adults, coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole with fesoterodine led to approximately a doubling of the maximum concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) of 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine (5-HMT), the active metabolite of fesoterodine. Compared with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers not taking ketoconazole, further increases in the exposure to 5-HMT were observed in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers taking ketoconazole [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, the average (90% confidence interval) increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., erythromycin, fluconazole, diltiazem, verapamil and grapefruit juice). The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.3 CYP3A4 Inducers No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers, such as rifampin and carbamazepine. Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. 7.4 CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not tested clinically. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP2D6 inhibitors. 7.5 Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 In vitro data indicate that at therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not have the potential to inhibit or induce Cytochrome P450 enzyme systems [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.6 Oral Contraceptives In the presence of fesoterodine, there are no clinically significant changes in the plasma concentrations of combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 ) ]. 7.7 Warfarin A clinical study has shown that fesoterodine extended-release tablets 8 mg once daily has no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or the anticoagulant activity (PT/INR) of warfarin 25 mg. Standard therapeutic monitoring for warfarin should be continued [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]. 7.8 Drug-Laboratory Test Interactions Interactions between fesoterodine fumarate and laboratory tests have not been studied"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data with the use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pregnant women and adolescents to evaluate for a drug associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies, oral administration of fesoterodine to pregnant mice and rabbits during organogenesis resulted in fetotoxicity at maternal exposures that were 6 and 3 times, respectively the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg/day based on AUC (see Data) . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population are unknown. However, in the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data No dose-related teratogenicity was observed in reproduction studies performed in mice and rabbits. In mice at 6 to 27 times the expected exposure at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 mg based on AUC (75 mg/kg/day, oral), increased resorptions and decreased live fetuses were observed. One fetus with cleft palate was observed at each dose (15, 45, and 75 mg/kg/day), at an incidence within the background historical range. In rabbits treated at 3 to 11 times the MRHD (27 mg/kg/day, oral), incompletely ossified sternebrae (retardation of bone development) and reduced survival were observed in fetuses. In rabbits at 9 to 11 times the MRHD (4.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), maternal toxicity and incompletely ossified sternebrae were observed in fetuses (at an incidence within the background historical range). In rabbits at 3 times the MRHD (1.5 mg/kg/day, subcutaneous), decreased maternal food consumption in the absence of any fetal effects was observed. Oral administration of 30 mg/kg/day fesoterodine to mice in a pre- and post-natal development study resulted in decreased body weight of the dams and delayed ear opening of the pups. No effects were noted on mating and reproduction of the F 1 dams or on the F 2 offspring. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information on the presence of fesoterodine fumarate in human milk, the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for fesoterodine fumarate and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from fesoterodine fumarate or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets have been established for the treatment of neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO) in pediatric patients aged 6 years and older and weighing greater than 25 kg. The information on this use is discussed throughout labeling. Use of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets for treatment of NDO is supported by evidence from a randomized, open-label trial with an initial 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age (Study 3) [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) and Clinical Studies (14.2)]. Study results demonstrated that treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) for patients weighing greater than 25 kg [see Clinical Studies (14.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. The most commonly reported adverse reactions in patients who received fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg in Study 3 (\u22652%) were diarrhea, UTI, dry mouth, constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, weight increase and headache [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Mean increases from baseline in heart rate were reported with both the 4 mg and 8 mg daily doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets, with larger mean increases reported in pediatric patients who received the 8 mg daily dose [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The safety and effectiveness of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release have not been established in pediatric patients younger than 6 years of age or weighing 25 kg or less. 8.5 Geriatric Use No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine are not significantly influenced by age. Of the 1,567 patients who received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg or 8 mg orally once daily in Phase 2 and 3, placebo-controlled, efficacy and safety studies for OAB, 515 (33%) were 65 years of age or older, and 140 (9%) were 75 years of age or older. No overall difference in effectiveness was observed between patients younger than 65 years of age and those 65 years of age or older in these studies; However, the incidence of antimuscarinic adverse reactions, including dry mouth, constipation, dyspepsia, increase in residual urine, dizziness ( 8 mg only) and urinary tract infection, was higher in patients 75 years of age and older as compared to younger patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. 8.6 Renal Impairment In adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. Doses of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets greater than 4 mg are not recommended in adult patients with severe renal impairment. In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) , and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 )]. The recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets in pediatric patients weighing greater than 25 kg and up to 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) is 4 mg once daily and fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is not recommend in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ). In pediatric patients weighing greater than 35 kg with mild-to-moderate renal impairment (eGFR 30 to 89 mL/min/1.73m 2 ), the recommended starting dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets is 4 mg orally once daily, with increase to the recommended dosage of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg orally once daily, and in those with severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m 2 ) the recommended dose is 4 mg once daily [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.4 )]. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied; therefore fesoterodine fumarate is not recommended for use in these patients. In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. No dose adjustment is recommended in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment [ see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )]."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption After oral administration, fesoterodine is well absorbed. Due to rapid and extensive hydrolysis by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, fesoterodine cannot be detected in plasma. Bioavailability of the active metabolite is 52%. After single or multiple-dose oral administration of fesoterodine in doses from 4 mg to 28 mg, plasma concentrations of the active metabolite are proportional to the dose. Maximum plasma levels are reached after approximately 5 hours. No accumulation occurs after multiple-dose administration. A Summary of pharmacokinetic parameters for the active metabolite after a single dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in extensive and poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 is provided in Table 8. Table 8: Summary of Geometric Mean [CV] Pharmacokinetic Parameters for the Active Metabolite After a Single Dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg and 8 mg in Extensive and Poor CYP2D6 Metabolizers Parameter Fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg Fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg EM (N=16) PM (N=8) EM (N=16) PM (N=8) C max (ng/mL) 1.89 [43%] 3.45 [54%] 3.98 [28%] 6.90 [39%] AUC 0-tz (ng*h/mL) 21.2 [38%] 40.5 [31%] 45.3 [32%] 88.7 [36%] t max (h) a 5 [2 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] 5 [3 to 6] 5 [5 to 6] t \u00bd (h) 7.31 [27%] 7.31 [30%] 8.59 [41%] 7.66 [21%] EM = extensive CYP2D6 metabolizer, PM = poor CYP2D6 metabolizer, CV = coefficient of variation C max = maximum plasma concentration, AUC 0-tz = area under the concentration time curve from zero up to the last measurable plasma concentration, t max = time to reach C max , t \u00bd = terminal half-life a Data presented as median (range) Effect of Food There is no clinically relevant effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a study of the effects of food on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine in 16 healthy male volunteers, concomitant food intake increased the active metabolite of fesoterodine AUC by approximately 19% and C max by 18% [ see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 )]. Distribution Plasma protein binding of the active metabolite is low (approximately 50%) and is primarily bound to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. The mean steady-state volume of distribution following intravenous infusion of the active metabolite is 169 L. Metabolism After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed to its active metabolite. The active metabolite is further metabolized in the liver to its carboxy, carboxy-N-desisopropyl, and N-desisopropyl metabolites via two major pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP3A4. None of these metabolites contribute significantly to the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Variability in CYP2D6 Metabolism A subset of individuals (approximately 7% of Caucasians and approximately 2% of African Americans) are poor metabolizers for CYP2D6. C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, as compared to extensive metabolizers. Excretion Hepatic metabolism and renal excretion contribute significantly to the elimination of the active metabolite. After oral administration of fesoterodine, approximately 70% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as the active metabolite (16%), carboxy metabolite (34%), carboxy-N-desisopropyl metabolite (18%), or N-desisopropyl metabolite (1%), and a smaller amount (7%) was recovered in feces. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite is approximately 4 hours following an intravenous administration. The apparent terminal half-life following oral administration is approximately 7 hours. Pharmacokinetics in Specific Populations Geriatric Patients Following a single 8 mg oral dose of fesoterodine, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in 12 elderly men (mean age 67 years) were 51.8 \u00b1 26.1 h*ng/mL and 3.8 \u00b1 1.7 ng/mL, respectively. In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 young men (mean age 30 years) were 52 \u00b1 31.5 h*ng/mL and 4.1 \u00b1 2.1 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by age [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.5 ) ]. Pediatric Patients In pediatric patients, from 6 years to 17 years of age with NDO weighing 35 kg with CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer status receiving fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets tablets, the mean values of apparent oral clearance, volume of distribution and absorption rate constant of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 72 L/h, 68 L and 0.09 h-1, respectively. The Tmax and half-life of 5-HMT are estimated to be approximately 2.55 h and 7.73 h, respectively. Like adults, the 5-HMT exposures in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers was estimated to be approximately 2-fold higher compared with extensive metabolizers. The post-hoc estimates of steady-state exposures of 5-HMT in NDO patients weighing greater than 25 kg following fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg and 8 mg tablets once daily are summarized in Table 9.

In the same study, the mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in 12 elderly women (mean age 68 years) were 56 \u00b1 28.8 h*ng/mL and 4.6 \u00b1 2.3 ng/mL, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by gender. Race The effects of Caucasian or Black race on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were examined in a study of 12 Caucasian and 12 Black African young male volunteers. Each subject received a single oral dose of 8 mg fesoterodine. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max for the active metabolite 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine in Caucasian males were 73 \u00b1 27.8 h*ng/mL and 6.1 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL, respectively. The mean (\u00b1SD) AUC and C max in Black males were 65.8 \u00b1 23.2 h*ng/mL and 5.5 \u00b1 1.9 ng/mL, respectively . The pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine were not significantly influenced by race. Renal Impairment In patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CL CR ranging from 30 to 80 mL/min), C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased up to 1.5- and 1.8-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. In patients with severe renal impairment (CL CR <30 mL/min), C max and AUC are increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively. [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.6 ) and Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 , 2.3)]. Hepatic Impairment In patients with moderate (Child-Pugh B) hepatic impairment, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.4- and 2.1-fold, respectively, as compared to healthy subjects. Subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) have not been studied [ see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.7 )]. Drug-Drug Interactions Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 At therapeutic concentrations, the active metabolite of fesoterodine does not inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, or 3A4, or induce CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, or 3A4 in vitro [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.5 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inhibitors Following blockade of CYP3A4 by coadministration of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2- and 2.3-fold, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers. In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. In a separate study coadministering fesoterodine with ketoconazole 200 mg once a day for 5 days, the C max and AUC values of the active metabolite of fesoterodine were increased 2.2-fold in CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and 1.5- and 1.9-fold, respectively, in CYP2D6 poor metabolizers. C max and AUC were 3.4- and 4.2-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole. There is no clinically relevant effect of moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors on the pharmacokinetics of fesoterodine. In a drug-drug interaction study evaluating the coadministration of the moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor fluconazole 200 mg twice a day for 2 days, a single 8 mg dose of fesoterodine was administered 1 hour following the first dose of fluconazole on day 1 of the study. The average (90% confidence interval) for the increase in C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine was approximately 19% (11% to 28%) and 27% (18% to 36%) respectively. The effect of weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine) was not examined; it is not expected to be in excess of the effect of moderate inhibitors [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.2 )], and Dosage and Administration ( 2.3 ) ]. CYP3A4 Inducers Following induction of CYP3A4 by coadministration of rifampicin 600 mg once a day, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine decreased by approximately 70% and 75%, respectively, after oral administration of fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg. The terminal half-life of the active metabolite was not changed. Induction of CYP3A4 may lead to reduced plasma levels. No dosing adjustments are recommended in the presence of CYP3A4 inducers [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.3 ) ]. CYP2D6 Inhibitors The interaction with CYP2D6 inhibitors was not studied. In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period crossover study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 \u2013 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [ see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the co-administration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anti-coagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 ) ]."

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Fesoterodine is a competitive muscarinic receptor antagonist. After oral administration, fesoterodine is rapidly and extensively hydrolyzed by nonspecific esterases to its active metabolite, 5-hydroxymethyl tolterodine, which is responsible for the antimuscarinic activity of fesoterodine. Muscarinic receptors play a role in contractions of urinary bladder smooth muscle. Inhibition of these receptors in the bladder is presumed to be the mechanism by which fesoterodine produces its effects."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In a urodynamic study involving patients with involuntary detrusor contractions, the effects after the administration of fesoterodine on the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity were assessed. Administration of fesoterodine increased the volume at first detrusor contraction and bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with an antimuscarinic effect on the bladder. Cardiac Electrophysiology The effect of fesoterodine 4 mg and 28 mg on the QT interval was evaluated in a double-blind, randomized, placebo- and positive-controlled (moxifloxacin 400 mg once a day) parallel trial with once-daily treatment over a period of 3 days in 261 male and female subjects aged 44 to 65 years. Electrocardiographic parameters were measured over a 24-hour period at pre-dose, after the first administration, and after the third administration of study medication. Fesoterodine 28 mg was chosen because this dose, when administered to CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers, results in an exposure to the active metabolite that is similar to the exposure in a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer receiving fesoterodine 8 mg together with CYP3A4 blockade. Corrected QT intervals (QTc) were calculated using Fridericia\u2019s correction and a linear individual correction method. Analyses of 24-hour average QTc, time-matched baseline-corrected QTc, and time-matched placebo-subtracted QTc intervals indicate that fesoterodine at doses of 4 and 28 mg/day did not prolong the QT interval. The sensitivity of the study was confirmed by positive QTc prolongation by moxifloxacin. In this study, conducted in subjects aged 44 to 65 years, fesoterodine fumarate was associated with an increase in heart rate that correlates with increasing dose. When compared to placebo, the mean increase in heart rate associated with fesoterodine 4 mg/day and fesoterodine 28 mg/day was 3 beats/minute and 11 beats/minute, respectively. In the two, phase 3, placebo-controlled studies in adult in patients with overactive bladder, the mean increases in heart rate compared to placebo were 3 to 4 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 4 mg/day group and 3 to 5 beats/minute in the fesoterodine 8 mg/day group."

In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers, C max and AUC of the active metabolite of fesoterodine increased 2.1- and 2.5-fold, respectively, during coadministration of ketoconazole 200 mg twice a day for 5 days. C max and AUC were 4.5- and 5.7-fold higher, respectively, in subjects who were CYP2D6 poor metabolizers and taking ketoconazole compared to subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers and not taking ketoconazole.

In poor metabolizers for CYP2D6, representing a maximum CYP2D6 inhibition, C max and AUC of the active metabolite are increased 1.7- and 2-fold, respectively. [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.4 ) ]. Oral Contraceptives Thirty healthy female subjects taking an oral contraceptive containing 0.03 mg ethinyl estradiol and 0.15 mg levonorgestrel were evaluated in a 2-period crossover study. Each subject was randomized to receive concomitant administration of either placebo or fesoterodine 8 mg once daily on days 1 to 14 of hormone cycle for 2 consecutive cycles. Pharmacokinetics of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel were assessed on day 13 of each cycle. Fesoterodine increased the AUC and C max of ethinyl estradiol by 1 \u2013 3% and decreased the AUC and C max of levonorgestrel by 11 to 13% [ see Drug Interactions (7.6) ]. Warfarin In a cross-over study in 14 healthy male volunteers (18 to 55 years), a single oral dose of warfarin 25 mg was given either alone or on day 3 of once daily dosing for 9 days with fesoterodine 8 mg. Compared to warfarin alone dosing, the C max and AUC of S-warfarin were lower by ~ 4 %, while the C max and AUC of R-warfarin were lower by approximately 8 % and 6% for the co-administration, suggesting absence of a significant pharmacokinetic interaction. There were no statistically significant changes in the measured pharmacodynamic parameters for anti-coagulant activity of warfarin (INR max , AUC INR ), with only a small decrease noted in INR max of ~ 3 % with the co-administration relative to warfarin alone. INR versus time profiles across individual subjects in the study suggested some differences following co-administration with fesoterodine, although there was no definite trend with regard to the changes noted [ see Drug Interactions ( 7.7 ) ]."

The highest tolerated doses in mice (females 45 to 60 mg/kg/day, males 30 to 45 mg/kg/day) correspond to 11 to 19 times (females) and 4 to 9 times (males) the estimated human AUC values reached with fesoterodine 8 mg, which is the Maximum Recommended Human Dose (MRHD). In rats, the highest tolerated dose (45 to 60 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 3 to 8 times (females) and 3 to 14 times (males) the estimated human AUC at the MRHD. Mutagenesis Fesoterodine was not mutagenic or genotoxic in vitro (Ames tests, chromosome aberration tests) or in vivo (mouse micronucleus test). Impairment of Fertility Fesoterodine had no effect on male reproductive function or fertility at doses up to 45 mg/kg/day in mice. At 45 mg/kg/day, a lower number of corpora lutea, implantation sites and viable fetuses was observed in female mice administered fesoterodine for 2 weeks prior to mating and continuing through day 7 of gestation.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Adult Overactive Bladder The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two, Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for \u2265 6-months duration, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes per 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm (an oral antimuscarinic agent). For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%) with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 to 91 years). The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours. An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition. Results for the primary endpoints and for mean change in voided volume per micturition from the two 12 week clinical studies of fesoterodine fumarate are reported in Table 10.

In Study 2, the number of these patients was 205, 228, and 218, respectively. Figures 1-4: The following figures show change from baseline over time in number of micturitions and urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 h in the two studies. A reduction in number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours was observed for both doses as compared to placebo as early as two weeks after starting fesoterodine fumarate therapy. figure1 figure2 figure3 figure4 14.2 Pediatric Neurogenic Detrusor Overactivity The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in Study 3 (NCT01557244), a Phase 3, randomized, open-label study consisting of a 12-week efficacy phase followed by a 12-week safety extension phase in pediatric patients from 6 years to 17 years of age. Two cohorts were studied. Cohort 1 (patients weighing greater than 25 kg) received a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg tablets orally once daily, or once daily. In the safety extension phase, patients randomized to the active comparator were switched to fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg once daily. For study inclusion, patients were required to have stable neurological disease and clinically or urodynamically-demonstrated NDO. Cohort 2 patients weighing less than 25 kg received an investigational fesoterodine formulation. During the 12-week efficacy phase, 124 patients (69 males and 55 females) were randomized to receive fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg (N=42), fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg (N=42), or active comparator (N=40) orally once daily. The majority of patients were Caucasian (52%) or Asian (44%) with a mean age of 11 years (range 6 years to 17 years) and a mean weight of 42.8 kg (range 25.1 to 96.0 kg). Primary Endpoint The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from baseline in maximum cystometric bladder capacity (MCBC) at Week 12. Treatment with fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg or 8 mg daily resulted in improvements from baseline to Week 12 in the primary efficacy endpoint, MCBC, for pediatric patients, with numerically higher changes from baseline for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 8 mg daily than for fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets 4 mg daily. Results for the primary endpoint MCBC are reported in Table 11.
