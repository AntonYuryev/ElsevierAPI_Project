      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5 mcg/mL. Metabolism Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole vaginal cream (0.4%). Microbiology Mechanism of action Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265 128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For vaginal use only. Terconazole Vaginal Cream 0.4% is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. Laboratory Tests If there is a lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C: There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (100x the intravaginal human dose of the 0.4% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20 to 40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increase incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 44 times the mean peak plasma level (0.004 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole vaginal cream 0.4%. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of terconazole vaginal cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

Based on comparative analyses with placebo, the adverse experiences considered most likely related to terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream were headache (26% vs. 17% with placebo) and body pain (2.1% vs. 0% with placebo). Fever (1.7% vs. 0.5% with placebo) and chills (0.4% vs. 0.0% with placebo), vulvovaginal burning, itching and irritation have also been reported. The adverse drug experience on terconazole most frequently causing discontinuation was vulvovaginal itching. Post-marketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been first identified during post-marketing experience with terconazole vaginal cream 0.4%.

A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. \u2022 Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. \u2022 Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. \u2022 Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. \u2022 Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. \u2022 Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. \u2022 Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infections. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better very quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. E. FOUGERA & CO.

During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream for three days. Based on comparative analyses with placebo and a standard agent, the adverse experiences considered most likely related to terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream were headache (21% vs. 16% with placebo) and dysmenorrhea (6% vs. 2% with placebo). Other adverse experiences reported with terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream were abdominal pain (3.4% vs. 1% with placebo) and fever (1% vs. 0.3% with placebo). The adverse drug experience most frequently causing discontinuation of therapy was vulvovaginal itching, 0.7% with the terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream group and 0.3% with the placebo group. Post-marketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been first identified during post-marketing experience with terconazole:. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption - Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64-76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5-16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution - Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5.0 mcg/mL. Metabolism - Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination - Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3.0%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing - There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole suppositories. Microbiology Mechanism of action - Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro - Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

      "PRECAUTIONS General - For vulvovaginal use only. Terconazole Vaginal Suppositories, 80 mg is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. The base contained in the suppository formulation may interact with certain rubber or latex products, such as those used in vaginal contraceptive diaphragms or latex condoms; therefore concurrent use is not recommended. Laboratory Tests - If there is a lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions - The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. The levels of estradiol and progesterone did not differ significantly when 0.8% terconazole vaginal cream was administered to healthy female volunteers established on a low dose oral contraceptive. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis - Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity - Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility - No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C - There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (25x the recommended intravaginal human dose of the suppository formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20-40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 17 times the mean peak plasma level (0.010 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus. Nursing Mothers - It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use - Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Geriatric Use - Clinical studies of terconazole vaginal suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, 284 patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppositories. Based on comparative analyses with placebo (295 patients), the adverse experiences considered adverse reactions most likely related to terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppositories were headache (30.3% vs. 20.7% with placebo) and pain of the female genitalia (4.2% vs. 0.7% with placebo). Adverse reactions that have also been reported but were not statistically significantly different from placebo were burning (15.2% vs. 11.2% with placebo) and body pain (3.9% vs. 1.7% with placebo). Fever (2.8% vs. 1.4% with placebo) and chills (1.8% vs. 0.7% with placebo) have also been reported. The adverse drug experience on terconazole most frequently causing discontinuation was burning (2.5% vs. 1.4% with placebo) and pruritus (1.8% vs. 1.4% with placebo). Post-marketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been first identified during post-marketing experience with Terconazole Vaginal Suppositories, 80 mg.

Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida , which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don\u2019t actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. \u2022 Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. \u2022 Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. \u2022 Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. \u2022 Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. \u2022 Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. \u2022 Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. The suppository formulation may damage the diaphragm or latex condom. Therefore, use of the diaphragm or latex condom during therapy with the suppository is not recommended. Consult your physician. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don\u2019t douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don\u2019t scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5 mcg/mL. Metabolism Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions were observed in some normal volunteers following repeated dermal application of terconazole 2% and 0.8% creams under conditions of filtered artificial ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole suppositories or vaginal cream (0.4% and 0.8%). Microbiology Mechanism of action Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265 128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

      "PRECAUTIONS General For vulvovaginal use only. Terconazole is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. Laboratory Tests If there is lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (100\u00d7 the recommended intravaginal human dose of the 0.4% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20 to 40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 44 times the mean peak plasma level (0.004 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of terconazole did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. Mfd. by: Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5.0 mcg/mL. Metabolism Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3.0%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2.0 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions were observed in some normal volunteers following repeated dermal application of terconazole 2% and 0.8% creams under conditions of filtered artificial ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole suppositories or vaginal cream (0.4% and 0.8%). Microbiology Mechanism of action Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For vulvovaginal use only. Terconazole is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. The base contained in the suppository formulation may interact with certain rubber or latex products, such as those used in vaginal contraceptive diaphragms or latex condoms; therefore concurrent use is not recommended. Laboratory Tests If there is lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions The therapeutic effect of this product is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (25\u00d7 the recommended intravaginal human dose of the suppository formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20 to 40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 17 times the mean peak plasma level (0.010 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of terconazole vaginal suppositories did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

See end flap of carton or suppository label for lot number and expiration date. A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. The suppository formulation (not the cream) may damage the diaphragm or latex condom. Therefore, use of the diaphragm or latex condom during therapy with the suppository is not recommended. Consult your physician. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. Figure Figure Figure Figure"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5 mcg/mL. Metabolism Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions were observed in some normal volunteers following repeated dermal application of terconazole 2% and 0.8% creams under conditions of filtered artificial ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole suppositories or vaginal cream (0.4% and 0.8%). Microbiology Mechanism of action Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For vulvovaginal use only. Terconazole is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. Laboratory Tests If there is lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. The levels of estradiol and progesterone did not differ significantly when 0.8% terconazole vaginal cream was administered to healthy female volunteers established on a low dose oral contraceptive. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (50\u00d7 the recommended intravaginal human dose of the 0.8% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20 to 40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 30 times the mean peak plasma level (0.006 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of terconazole did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream for three days. Based on comparative analyses with placebo and a standard agent, the adverse experiences considered most likely related to terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream were headache (21% vs. 16% with placebo) and dysmenorrhea (6% vs. 2% with placebo). Other adverse experiences reported with terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream were abdominal pain (3.4% vs. 1% with placebo) and fever (1% vs. 0.3% with placebo). The adverse drug experience most frequently causing discontinuation of therapy was vulvovaginal itching, 0.7% with the terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream group and 0.3% with the placebo group. Post-marketing Experience The following adverse drug reactions have been first identified during post-marketing experience with terconazole:. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure.

A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5 mcg/mL. Metabolism Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions were observed in some normal volunteers following repeated dermal application of terconazole 2% and 0.8% creams under conditions of filtered artificial ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole suppositories or vaginal cream (0.4% and 0.8%). Microbiology Mechanism of action Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General For vulvovaginal use only. Terconazole is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. Laboratory Tests If there is lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. The levels of estradiol and progesterone did not differ significantly when 0.8% terconazole vaginal cream was administered to healthy female volunteers established on a low dose oral contraceptive. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (50\u00d7 the recommended intravaginal human dose of the 0.8% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20 to 40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 30 times the mean peak plasma level (0.006 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and efficacy in children have not been established. Geriatric Use Clinical studies of terconazole did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients."

During controlled clinical studies conducted in the United States, patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream for three days. Based on comparative analyses with placebo and a standard agent, the adverse experiences considered most likely related to terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream were headache (21% vs. 16% with placebo) and dysmenorrhea (6% vs. 2% with placebo). Other adverse experiences reported with terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream were abdominal pain (3.4% vs. 1% with placebo) and fever (1% vs. 0.3% with placebo). The adverse drug experience most frequently causing discontinuation of therapy was vulvovaginal itching, 0.7% with the terconazole 0.8% vaginal cream group and 0.3% with the placebo group.

A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. Figure 1 Figure 2 Figure 3 Figure 4"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Following intravaginal administration of terconazole in humans, absorption ranged from 5-8% in three hysterectomized subjects and 12-16% in two non-hysterectomized subjects with tubal ligations. Following daily intravaginal administration of 0.8% terconazole 40 mg (0.8% cream x 5 g) for seven days to normal humans, plasma concentrations were low and gradually rose to a daily peak (mean of 5.9 ng/mL or 0.006 mcg/mL) at 6.6 hours. Results from similar studies in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis indicate that the slow rate of absorption, the lack of accumulation, and the mean peak plasma concentration of terconazole was not different from that observed in healthy women. The absorption characteristics of terconazole 0.8% in pregnant or non-pregnant patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were also similar to those found in normal volunteers. Following oral (30 mg) administration of 14 C-labelled terconazole, the harmonic half-life of elimination from the blood for the parent terconazole was 6.9 hours (range 4.0-11.3). Terconazole is extensively metabolized; the plasma AUC for terconazole compared to the AUC for total radioactivity was 0.6%. Total radioactivity was eliminated from the blood with a harmonic half-life of 52.2 hours (range 44-60). Excretion of radioactivity was both by renal (32-56%) and fecal (47-52%) routes. In vitro , terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration. Photosensitivity reactions were observed in some normal volunteers following repeated dermal application of terconazole 2.0% and 0.8% creams under conditions of filtered artificial ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole suppositories or vaginal cream 0.8%. Microbiology: Terconazole exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against Candida albicans . Antifungal activity also has been demonstrated against other fungi. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were > 128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment. The exact pharmacologic mode of action of terconazole is uncertain; however, it may exert its antifungal activity by the disruption of normal fungal cell membrane permeability. No resistance to terconazole has developed during successive passages of C. albicans."

      "PRECAUTIONS General: Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. Laboratory Tests: If there is a lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiological studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions: The therapeutic effect of this product is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Carcinogenesis: Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity: Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility: No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Pregnancy Category C: There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (50x the recommended intravaginal human dose of the 0.8% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20-40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increase incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 30 times the mean peak plasma level (0.006 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole vaginal cream 0.8%. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, and because of the potential for adverse reaction in nursing infants from terconazole, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

See end flap for lot number and expiration date. A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida , which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. \u2022 Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. \u2022 Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. \u2022 Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. \u2022 Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. \u2022 Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. \u2022 Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infections. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better very quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. E. FOUGERA & CO. A division of Fougera Pharmaceuticals Inc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5 mcg/mL. Metabolism Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions were observed in some normal volunteers following repeated dermal application of terconazole 2% and 0.8% creams under conditions of filtered artificial ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole suppositories or vaginal cream (0.4% and 0.8%). Microbiology Mechanism of action Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 17 times the mean peak plasma level (0.010 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 80 mg vaginal suppository. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient.

See end flap of carton or suppository label for lot number and expiration date. A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. The suppository formulation (not the cream) may damage the diaphragm or latex condom. Therefore, use of the diaphragm or latex condom during therapy with the suppository is not recommended. Consult your physician. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. Mfd. by: Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5 mcg/mL. Metabolism Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1 SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions were observed in some normal volunteers following repeated dermal application of terconazole 2% and 0.8% creams under conditions of filtered artificial ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole suppositories or vaginal cream (0.4% and 0.8%). Microbiology Mechanism of action Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265 128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

      "PRECAUTIONS General For vulvovaginal use only. Terconazole is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. Laboratory Tests If there is lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (100\u00d7 the recommended intravaginal human dose of the 0.4% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20 to 40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increased incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 44 times the mean peak plasma level (0.004 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Animal studies have shown that rat offspring exposed via the milk of treated (40 mg/kg/orally) dams showed decreased survival during the first few post-partum days, but overall pup weight and weight gain were comparable to or greater than controls throughout lactation.

The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 44 times the mean peak plasma level (0.004 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole 0.4% vaginal cream. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient. Terconazole may be used during the second and third trimester if the potential benefit outweighs the possible risks to the fetus."

A WORD ABOUT YEAST INFECTIONS Why do yeast infections occur? Yeast infections are caused by an organism called Candida (KAN di duh). It may be present in small and harmless amounts in the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina. Sometimes the natural balance of the vagina becomes upset. This may lead to rapid growth of Candida, which results in a yeast infection. Symptoms of a yeast infection include itching, burning, redness, and an abnormal discharge. Your doctor can make the diagnosis of a yeast infection by evaluating your symptoms and looking at a sample of the discharge under the microscope. How can I prevent yeast infections? Certain factors may increase your chance of developing a yeast infection. These factors don't actually cause the problem, but they may create a situation that allows the yeast to grow rapidly. Clothing: Tight jeans, nylon underwear, pantyhose, and wet bathing suits can hold in heat and moisture (two conditions in which yeast organisms thrive). Looser pants or skirts, 100% cotton underwear, and stockings may help avoid this problem. Diet: Cutting down on sweets, milk products, and artificial sweeteners may reduce the risk of yeast infections. Antibiotics: Antibiotics work by eliminating disease-causing organisms. While they are helpful in curing other problems, antibiotics may lead to an overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Pregnancy: Hormonal changes in the body during pregnancy encourage the growth of yeast. This is a very common time for an infection to occur. Until the baby is born, it may be hard to completely eliminate yeast infections. If you believe you are pregnant, tell your doctor. Menstruation: Sometimes monthly changes in hormone levels may lead to yeast infections. Diabetes: In addition to heat and moisture, yeast thrives on sugar. Because diabetics often have sugar in their urine, their vaginas are rich in this substance. Careful control of diabetes may help prevent yeast infection. Controlling these factors can help eliminate yeast infections and may prevent them from coming back. Some other helpful tips: 1. For best results, be sure to use the medication as prescribed by your doctor, even if you feel better quickly. 2. Avoid sexual intercourse, if your doctor advises you to do so. 3. If your partner has any penile itching, redness, or discomfort, he should consult his physician and mention that you are being treated for a yeast infection. 4. You can use the medication even if you are having your menstrual period. However, you should not use tampons because they may absorb the medication. Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. Mfd. by: Taro Pharmaceuticals Inc.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Absorption Following a single intravaginal application of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to healthy women, approximately 70% (range: 64 to 76%) of terconazole remains in the vaginal area during the suppository retention period (16 hours); approximately 10% (range: 5 to 16%) of the administered radioactivity was absorbed systemically over 7 days. Maximum plasma concentrations of terconazole occur 5 to 10 hours after intravaginal application of the cream or suppository. Systemic exposure to terconazole is approximately proportional to the applied dose, whether as the cream or suppository. The rate and extent of absorption of terconazole are similar in patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis (pregnant or non-pregnant) and healthy subjects. Distribution Terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) in human plasma and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration over the range of 0.01 to 5 mcg/mL. Metabolism Systemically absorbed terconazole is extensively metabolized (>95%). Elimination Across various studies in healthy women, after single or multiple intravaginal administration of terconazole as the cream or suppository/ovule, the mean elimination half-life of unchanged terconazole ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 hours. Following a single intravaginal administration of a suppository containing 240 mg 14 C-terconazole to hysterectomized or tubal ligated women, approximately 3 to 10% (mean \u00b1SD: 5.7 \u00b1 3%) of the administered radioactivity was eliminated in the urine and 2 to 6% (mean \u00b1 SD: 4.2 \u00b1 1.6%) was eliminated in the feces during the 7-day collection period. Multiple Dosing There is no significant increase in maximum plasma concentration or overall exposure (AUC) after multiple daily applications of the cream for 7 days or suppositories for 3 days. Photosensitivity reactions have not been observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with terconazole vaginal cream (0.4%). Microbiology Mechanism of action Terconazole, an azole antifungal agent, inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450-mediated 14 alpha-lanosterol demethylase enzyme. This enzyme functions to convert lanosterol to ergosterol. The accumulation of 14 alpha-methyl sterols correlates with the subsequent loss of ergosterol in the fungal cell wall and may be responsible for the antifungal activity of terconazole. Mammalian cell demethylation is less sensitive to terconazole inhibition. Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits antifungal activity in vitro against Candida albicans and other Candida species. The MIC values of terconazole against most Lactobacillus spp. typically found in the human vagina were \u2265 128 mcg/mL; therefore these beneficial bacteria are not affected by drug treatment."

      "PRECAUTIONS General For vaginal use only. Terconazole Vaginal Cream 0.4% is not for ophthalmic or oral use. Discontinue use and do not retreat with terconazole if sensitization, irritation, fever, chills or flu-like symptoms are reported during use. Laboratory Tests If there is a lack of response to terconazole, appropriate microbiologic studies (standard KOH smear and/or cultures) should be repeated to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other pathogens. Drug Interactions The therapeutic effect of terconazole is not affected by oral contraceptive usage. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis Studies to determine the carcinogenic potential of terconazole have not been performed. Mutagenicity Terconazole was not mutagenic when tested in vitro for induction of microbial point mutations (Ames test), or for inducing cellular transformation, or in vivo for chromosome breaks (micronucleus test) or dominant lethal mutations in mouse germ cells. Impairment of Fertility No impairment of fertility occurred when female rats were administered terconazole orally up to 40 mg/kg/day for a three month period. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects, Pregnancy Category C: There was no evidence of teratogenicity when terconazole was administered orally up to 40 mg/kg/day (100x the intravaginal human dose of the 0.4% vaginal cream formulation) in rats, or 20 mg/kg/day in rabbits, or subcutaneously up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats. Dosages at or below 10 mg/kg/day produced no embryotoxicity; however, there was a delay in fetal ossification at 10 mg/kg/day in rats. There was some evidence of embryotoxicity in rabbits and rats at 20 to 40 mg/kg. In rats, this was reflected as a decrease in litter size and number of viable young and reduced fetal weight. There was also delay in ossification and an increase incidence of skeletal variants. The no-effect dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 44 times the mean peak plasma level (0.004 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole vaginal cream 0.4%. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. Since terconazole is absorbed from the human vagina, it should not be used in the first trimester of pregnancy unless the physician considers it essential to the welfare of the patient.

Instead, use external pads or napkins until you have finished your medication. You may also wish to wear a sanitary napkin if the vaginal medication leaks. 5. Dry the genital area thoroughly after showering, bathing, or swimming. Change out of a wet bathing suit or damp exercise clothes as soon as possible. A dry environment is less likely to encourage the growth of yeast. 6. Wipe from front to rear (away from the vagina) after a bowel movement. 7. Don't douche unless your doctor specifically tells you to do so. Douching may disturb the vaginal balance. 8. Don't scratch if you can help it. Scratching can cause more irritation and spread the infection. 9. Discuss with your physician any medication you are already taking. Certain types of medication can make your vagina more susceptible to infection. 10. Eat nutritious meals to promote your general health. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. E. FOUGERA & CO.

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use and estimating their relative rates. During a controlled clinical trial conducted in the United States, patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were treated with Terconazole Vaginal Cream, 0.8% for 3 days (n=231) or Terazol\u00ae3 for 3 days (n=229) [see Clinical Studies (14)]. Table 1 lists the adverse reactions occurring in \u22652% of patients receiving Terconazole Vaginal Cream in the trial. The therapy-related discontinuation rate was 2.0% for Terconazole Vaginal Cream. The adverse reaction most frequently causing discontinuation of Terconazole Vaginal Cream therapy was vulvovaginal itching (0.7%).

Photosensitivity reactions were observed in some normal volunteers following repeated dermal application of terconazole 2.0% (not an approved strength) and 0.8% creams under conditions of filtered artificial ultraviolet light. Photosensitivity reactions were not observed in U.S. and foreign clinical trials in patients who were treated with other terconazole formulations (i.e., terconazole suppositories or vaginal cream, 0.8%)."

Available data from observational studies with terconazole use in pregnancy are insufficient to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. In animal reproduction studies with oral terconazole, no adverse development effects were observed at clinically relevant systemic exposures (see Data). The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data There was no evidence of malformations when terconazole was administered orally in rats, or rabbits. There was a delay in fetal ossification at an oral dose of 10 mg/kg/day in rats. Higher doses resulted in decreased litter size, decreased number of viable young and reduced fetal weight in rats. There was also a delay in ossification and an increase incidence of skeletal variants. The dose of 10 mg/kg/day resulted in a mean peak plasma level of terconazole in pregnant rats of 0.176 mcg/mL which exceeds by 30 times the mean peak plasma level (0.006 mcg/mL) seen in normal subjects after intravaginal administration of terconazole vaginal cream 0.8%. This safety assessment does not account for possible exposure of the fetus through direct transfer to terconazole from the irritated vagina by diffusion across amniotic membranes. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of terconazole in human milk, the effect on the breast-fed infant or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for Terconazole Vaginal Cream and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed infant from Terconazole Vaginal Cream or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of Terconazole Vaginal Cream have not been established in female pediatric patients for the treatment of vulvovaginal candidiasis. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Terconazole Vaginal Cream did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects."

Following daily intravaginal administration of 0.8% terconazole 40 mg (0.8% cream x 5 g) for seven days to healthy female subjects, plasma concentrations were low and gradually rose to a daily peak (mean of 5.9 ng/mL or 0.006 mcg/mL) at 6.6 hours. Results from similar studies in female patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis indicate that the slow rate of absorption, the lack of accumulation, and the mean peak plasma concentration of terconazole was not different from that observed in healthy females. The absorption characteristics of terconazole vaginal cream, 0.8% in pregnant or non-pregnant patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis were also similar to those found in healthy subjects. Following oral (30 mg) administration of 14 C-labelled terconazole, the mean half-life of elimination from the blood for the parent terconazole was 6.9 hours (range 4.0-11.3). Terconazole is extensively metabolized; the plasma AUC for terconazole compared to the AUC for total radioactivity was 0.6%. Total radioactivity was eliminated from the blood with a mean elimination half-life of 52.2 hours (range 44-60). Excretion of radioactivity was both by renal (32-56%) and fecal (47- 52%) routes. In vitro , terconazole is highly protein bound (94.9%) and the degree of binding is independent of drug concentration. 12.4 Microbiology Mechanism of Action Terconazole inhibits the enzyme cytochrome P450 14\u03b1-demethylase which leads to inhibition of ergosterol synthesis, an essential component of the fungal cell membrane Activity in vitro Terconazole exhibits fungicidal activity in vitro against Candida albicans . Drug Resistance Studies showed no development of resistance to terconazole during successive passages of C. albicans . However, the clinical significance of such an effect is not known."
