      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The following clinically significant adverse reactions are described elsewhere in the labeling: \u2022 Photosensitivity [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] Most common adverse reactions (> 5%) at the application site are rash, pain, paresthesia, pruritis, exfoliative dermatitis, edema, and skin disorders. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Advanz Pharma (US) Corp. at 1-877-370-1142 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of PANRETIN GEL was assessed in two multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials (Trial 1 and Trial 2) in patients with cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . In a pooled analysis of both trials, the most common adverse reactions in \u2265 5% of patients were rash, pain, paresthesia, pruritis, exfoliative dermatitis, edema, and skin disorder. In Trial 1, severe local skin adverse reactions (erythema and edema with or without vesiculation) occurred in 10% of patients during the first 12 weeks of treatment (versus 0% in the vehicle control). Adverse reactions led to withdrawal from the study in 7% of patients. In Trial 2, severe local skin adverse reactions (erythema and edema with or without vesiculation) occurred in 6% of patients during the first 12 weeks of treatment (versus 0% in the vehicle control) and 1 patient withdrew due to severe skin irritation. Table 1 lists the most common application site adverse reactions that occurred in a least 5% of patients during the double-blind phase who received PANRETIN GEL in either of the two controlled studies.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS \u2022 Pregnancy : Can cause fetal harm ( 8.1 ) \u2022 Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action, PANRETIN GEL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Oral administration of alitretinoin to pregnant animals during the period of organogenesis was teratogenic and embryo lethal at exposures at least 5 times the estimated daily human topical dose ( see Data ). There are no data on the use of PANRETIN GEL in pregnant women. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to the fetus. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data Oral administration of alitretinoin to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in early resorptions, post-implantation loss, and fetal defects (limb, craniofacial, fused sternebrae) at doses \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day (approximately 5 times the estimated daily human topical dose based on body surface area, assuming complete systemic absorption of alitretinoin, when PANRETIN GEL is administered as a 60 g tube over 1 month in a 60 kg human). Early resorptions and post-implantation loss also occurred in rats administered oral alitretinoin at doses \u22655 mg/kg/day (approximately 25 times the estimated daily human topical dose based on body surface area). Limb and craniofacial defects also occurred in mice administered oral alitretinoin on day 11 of gestation at single doses \u226550 mg/kg (approximately 127 times the estimated daily human topical dose based on body surface area). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary It is not known whether alitretinoin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for adverse reactions from PANRETIN GEL in the nursing child, advise patients that breastfeeding is not recommended during treatment with PANRETIN GEL and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating PANRETIN GEL. Contraception Females PANRETIN GEL can cause embryo-fetal harm when administered to pregnant women [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.1 )] . Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PANRETIN GEL and for 1 week after the last dose. Males Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with PANRETIN GEL and for 1 week after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of PANRETIN GEL have not been established in pediatric patients. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of PANRETIN GEL did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger adult patients."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Alitretinoin (9-cis-retinoic acid) is a naturally occurring endogenous retinoid that binds to and activates all known intracellular retinoid receptor subtypes (RAR\u03b1, RAR\u03b2, RAR\u03b3, RXR\u03b1, RXR\u03b2 and RXR\u03b3). Once activated these receptors function as transcription factors that regulate the expression of genes that control the process of cellular differentiation and proliferation in both normal and neoplastic cells. Alitretinoin inhibits the growth of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (KS) cells in vitro. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Alitretinoin exposure-response relationships and the time course of pharmacodynamic response are unknown. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The range of 9-cis-retinoic acid plasma concentrations in patients with cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS after multiple daily applications of PANRETIN GEL for up to 60 weeks was similar to the range of circulating, naturally occurring 9-cis-retinoic acid plasma concentrations in untreated healthy participants. Elimination Metabolism 9-cis-retinoic acid is metabolized to 4-hydroxy-9-cis-retinoic acid and 4-oxo-9-cis-retinoic acid by CYP2C9, 3A4, 1A1, and 1A2. 4-oxo-9-cis-retinoic acid is the major circulating metabolite following oral administration of 9-cis-retinoic acid."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma PANRETIN GEL was evaluated in two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled studies in adult patients with cutaneous lesions of AIDS-related KS. In both studies the primary efficacy objective was the patients\u2019 cutaneous KS tumor response rate through 12 weeks of study drug treatment which was assessed by evaluating from 3 to 8 KS index lesions according to the modified AIDS Clinical Trials Group (ACTG) response criteria as applied to topical therapy (i.e., evaluation of height and area reductions of the index lesions only; progressive disease in non-index lesions and new lesions were not considered progressive disease; progressive disease was scored only in the treated index lesions). A global evaluation by physicians was also carried out. It considered all the patient\u2019s treated lesions (index and other) compared to baseline. In this evaluation, patients with at least a 50% improvement in the KS lesions were considered responders. In addition, photographs of lesions in patients considered responders by the modified ACTG criteria were examined by the FDA for a cosmetically beneficial response, defined as at least a 50% improvement in appearance compared to baseline, considering both the KS lesions and dermal toxicity at the lesion site, in at least 50% of the index lesions and maintained for at least 3 weeks. Visceral disease was not monitored in these trials and the appearance of new KS lesions was not considered part of the response assessment. In Trial 1, a total of 268 patients were entered from centers in the U.S. and Canada. Patients were treated topically three to four times a day with either PANRETIN GEL or a matching vehicle gel for a minimum of 12 weeks, followed by an open-label phase in patients who had not yet progressed on PANRETIN GEL. Median age of patients was 39 years, 99% were men, 75% were White, 16% Hispanic, and 7% Black. Fifty-seven percent of patients had a CD4+ lymphocyte count <200/mm3 and 36% had CD4+ lymphocyte count less than 100/mm3; 12% had visceral KS. Responses during the double-blind phase are shown in Table 2 . New lesions in untreated areas were seen in about 50% of patients. Trial 2 was an international study with a planned enrollment of 270 patients. Patients were treated topically twice a day with PANRETIN GEL or a matching vehicle for 12 weeks. The study was stopped early because of positive-interim results in the initial 82 patients. Median age of patients was 36 years for PANRETIN-GEL and 39 years for matching vehicle; all patients were men; 89% White; 5% Hispanic, and 4% Black; 67% had a CD4+ lymphocyte count \u2264200/mm3 and 39% had CD4+ lymphocyte count \u2264100/mm3; and 16% had visceral KS. Results of the study are shown in Table 2 . Responses to PANRETIN GEL were seen both in previously untreated patients and in patients with prior systemic and/or topical KS treatment.
