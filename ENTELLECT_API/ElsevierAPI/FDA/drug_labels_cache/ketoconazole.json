      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ). This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale. Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale ( Malassezia ovale ) and Pityrosporum orbiculare ( M. furfur ) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ) . Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue ketoconazole shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. CARCINOGENESIS & MUTAGENESIS & IMPAIRMENT OF FERTILITY Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. PREGNANCY Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. NURSING MOTHERS There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when ketoconazole shampoo, 2% is administered to a nursing woman. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

In three open label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-marketing experience with ketoconazole shampoo: there have been reports of hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale , but: this has not been proven."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Ketoconazole Cream, 2% is not for ophthalmic use. Ketoconazole Cream, 2% contains sodium sulfite anhydrous, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) . This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale . Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale (Malassezia ovale) and Pityrosporum orbiculare (M. furfur) .

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) . This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale . Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale (Malassezia ovale) and Pityrosporum orbiculare (M. furfur) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ). Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients: Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue ketoconazole shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing mothers: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Experience In 11 double-blind trials in 264 patients using ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, for the treatment of dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis, an increase in normal hair loss and irritation occurred in less than 1% of patients. In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-marketing experience with ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: there have been reports of hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions."

      "WARNING Because ketoconazole tablets have been associated with serious adverse reactions (see WARNINGS section), ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Somepatients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Patients receiving this drug should be informed by the physician of the risk and should be closely monitored. See WARNINGS section.4 QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may prolong QT intervals, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.

      "DESCRIPTION Ketoconazole tablets USP is a synthetic broad-spectrum antifungal agent available in scored white tablets, each containing 200 mg ketoconazole base for oral administration. Inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and methylcellulose. Ketoconazole is cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl] methoxy]phenyl] piperazine and has the following structural formula: Ketoconazole is a white to slightly beige, odorless powder, soluble in acids, with a molecular weight of 531.44g/moL. FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP. image description"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketonazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g.H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section: PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and the piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative 0-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Maximum plasma concentrations occured 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT interval. Data from some clinical PK/PO studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lenosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity in Vitro & in Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative side effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloid such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Liver Diseases The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease.

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole con prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone,cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose pf 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (120 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatotoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATION INCREASED '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATION INCREASED '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficiency. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs of symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketocona zole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers Tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE KETOCONAZOLE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS'. Telithromycin: A multiple- dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that Cmax of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk of vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used with at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse effects. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics Lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and lorsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the Cmax and AUG of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1 x (mouse) or 2 x (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface are comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic effects Ketaconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breastfeed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under two years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale , but: this has not been proven."

      "WARNINGS Ketoconazole Cream, 2% is not for ophthalmic use. Ketoconazole Cream, 2% contains sodium sulfite anhydrous, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When ketoconazole cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/mL. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/mL level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole cream, 2%. Microbiology Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not been proven."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) . This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale . Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale (Malassezia ovale) and Pityrosporum orbiculare (M. furfur) .

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When ketoconazole cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/mL. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/mL level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole cream, 2%. Microbiology Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not been proven."

Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk.

      "DESCRIPTION Ketoconazole tablets USP is a synthetic broad-spectrum antifungal agent available in scored white tablets, each containing 200 mg ketoconazole base for oral administration. Inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and methylcellulose. Ketoconazole is cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl] methoxyl]phenyl] piperazine and has the following structural formula: Ketoconazole is a white to slightly beige, odorless powder, soluble in acids, with a molecular weight of 531.44g/mol. FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT c interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT c interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis."

      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers Tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE KETOCONAZOLE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS '. Telithromycin: A multiple- dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics alprazolam, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. </td></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\"Lrule Botrule Rrule\" align=\"left\"> Antivirals </td><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\"/><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\"/><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\" align=\"left\"> indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir </td><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\"/></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\"Lrule Botrule Rrule\" align=\"left\"> Beta Blockers </td><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\"/><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\"/><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\" align=\"left\"> nadolol </td><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\"/></tr><tr><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\"Lrule Botrule Rrule\" align=\"left\"> Calcium Channel Blockers </td><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\" align=\"left\"> felodipine, nisoldipine </td><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\"/><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\" align=\"left\"> other dihydropyridines,  verapamil </td><td valign=\"top\" styleCode=\" Botrule Rrule\" align=\"left\"> Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ). This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action- Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale. Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology- Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale ( Malassezia ovale ) and Pityrosporum orbiculare ( M. furfur ) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ) . Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients- Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility- Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro , the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT c interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT c interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis , Coccidioides immitis , Histoplasma capsulatum , Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ."

    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Hypersensitivity Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug."

      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations '. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics alprazolam, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations '. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics alprazolam, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours."

In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When ketoconazole cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/mL. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/mL level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole cream, 2%. Microbiology Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not been proven."

The Ames' salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.

The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. The safety data presented in Table 1 reflect exposure to ketoconazole foam, 2% in 672 subjects, 12 years and older with seborrheic dermatitis.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of ketoconazole foam, 2% to women who are breastfeeding. In animal studies ketoconazole was found in milk following oral administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ketoconazole foam, 2% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ketoconazole foam, 2% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility In animal fertility studies in rats and dogs, administration of oral doses of ketoconazole between 3-day and 3-month periods resulted in infertility that was reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole foam, 2% in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 44 (7%) were from 12 to 17 years of age. [See Clinical Studies (14) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 107 (16%) were 65 years and over. Clinical trials of ketoconazole foam, 2% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects."

In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice (18-months) and rats (24-months) at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic. The high dose in these studies was approximately 2.4 to 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential. In three in vivo assays (sister chromatid exchange in humans, dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice), ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential. In animal fertility studies, oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner. In females, oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) had no effect on fertility, while doses of 75 mg/kg (4.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites. In male rats, oral dosing at 200 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility. When administered for longer durations (up to 3 months), decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In male beagle dogs, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks (5.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) resulted in decreased sperm motility, decreased sperm count, increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Ketoconazole tablets USP is a synthetic broad-spectrum antifungal agent available in scored white tablets, each containing 200 mg ketoconazole base for oral administration. Inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and methylcellulose. Ketoconazole is cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl] methoxyl]phenyl] piperazine and has the following structural formula: Ketoconazole is a white to slightly beige, odorless powder, soluble in acids, with a molecular weight of 531.44g/mol. FDA approved dissolution test specifications differ from USP. Image"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT c interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT c interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration."
    ],
    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease.

      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers Tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS ]. Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE KETOCONAZOLE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS '. Telithromycin: A multiple- dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics Lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When ketoconazole cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/mL. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/mL level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole cream, 2%. Microbiology Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not been proven."

Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT c interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT c interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration."

    "microbiology": [
      "MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions (see PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS ). Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS .)

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers Tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS ]. Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE KETOCONAZOLE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS '. Telithromycin: A multiple- dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics Lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale , but: this has not been proven."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Ketoconazole Cream, 2% is not for ophthalmic use. Ketoconazole Cream, 2% contains sodium sulfite anhydrous, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of ketoconazole foam, 2% to women who are breastfeeding.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons)."

In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice (18-months) and rats (24-months) at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic. The high dose in these studies was approximately 2.4 to 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential. In three in vivo assays (sister chromatid exchange in humans, dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice), ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential. In animal fertility studies, oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner. In females, oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) had no effect on fertility, while doses of 75 mg/kg (4.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites. In male rats, oral dosing at 200 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility. When administered for longer durations (up to 3 months), decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In male beagle dogs, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks (5.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) resulted in decreased sperm motility, decreased sperm count, increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes. These effects were reversed subsequent to withdrawal of treatment."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ). This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action- Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale. Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology- Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale ( Malassezia ovale ) and Pityrosporum orbiculare ( M. furfur ) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ) . Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients- Patients should be advised of the following: \u2022 Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. \u2022 The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. \u2022 Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility- Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing Mothers- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is administered to a nursing woman.

Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro , the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT C interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT C interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis , Coccidioides immitis , Histoplasma capsulatum , Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions. (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Hypersensitivity Ketoconazole tablets are contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Coadministration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g., acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4- metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects . Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics Lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2 fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3 fold and 10.9 fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5 fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18 month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24 month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1x (mouse) or 2x (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g., acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4- metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects . Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics Lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2 fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3 fold and 10.9 fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5 fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison)."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale , but: this has not been proven."

Ketoconazole Cream, 2% contains sodium sulfite anhydrous, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people.

Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) . This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale . Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale (Malassezia ovale) and Pityrosporum orbiculare (M. furfur) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ). Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients: Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue ketoconazole shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing mothers: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale , but: this has not been proven."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions observed in clinical studies (incidence >1%) were application site burning and application site reaction ( 6.1 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Padagis \u00ae at 1-866-634-9120 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch . 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug, and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The adverse reaction information from clinical trials does, however, provide a basis for identifying the adverse reactions that appear to be related to drug use and for approximating rates. The safety data presented in Table 1 reflect exposure to ketoconazole foam, 2% in 672 subjects, 12 years and older with seborrheic dermatitis. Subjects applied ketoconazole foam, 2% or vehicle foam twice daily for 4 weeks to affected areas on the face, scalp, and/or chest.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of ketoconazole foam, 2% to women who are breastfeeding. In animal studies ketoconazole was found in milk following oral administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ketoconazole foam, 2% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ketoconazole foam, 2% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility In animal fertility studies in rats and dogs, administration of oral doses of ketoconazole between 3-day and 3-month periods resulted in infertility that was reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole foam, 2% in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 44 (7%) were from 12 to 17 years of age. [See Clinical Studies (14) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 107 (16%) were 65 years and over. Clinical trials of ketoconazole foam, 2% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or photo-carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole foam, 2%. In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice (18-months) and rats (24-months) at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic. The high dose in these studies was approximately 2.4 to 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential. In three in vivo assays (sister chromatid exchange in humans, dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice), ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential. In animal fertility studies, oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner. In females, oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) had no effect on fertility, while doses of 75 mg/kg (4.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites. In male rats, oral dosing at 200 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility. When administered for longer durations (up to 3 months), decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In male beagle dogs, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks (5.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) resulted in decreased sperm motility, decreased sperm count, increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes. These effects were reversed subsequent to withdrawal of treatment."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When ketoconazole cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole cream, 2%. Microbiology Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum , T. mentagrophytes , T. tonsurans , Microsporum canis , M. audouini , M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames\u2019 Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether ketoconazole cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200-mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro , the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT c interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT c interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis , Coccidioides immitis , Histoplasma capsulatum , Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine, cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Hypersensitivity Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Coadministration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations '. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations '. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When ketoconazole cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/mL. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/mL level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole cream, 2%. Microbiology Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not been proven."

Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether ketoconazole cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Clinical improvement may be seen fairly soon after treatment is begun; however, candidal infections and tinea cruris and corporis should be treated for two weeks in order to reduce the possibility of recurrence. Patients with tinea versicolor usually require two weeks of treatment. Patients with tinea pedis require six weeks of treatment. Seborrheic dermatitis Ketoconazole cream, 2% should be applied to the affected area twice daily for four weeks or until clinical clearing. If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined."

      "WARNING Because ketoconazole tablets have been associated with serious adverse reactions (see WARNINGS section), ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Patients receiving this drug should be informed by the physician of the risk and should be closely monitored. See WARNINGS section. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Coadministration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may prolong QT intervals, sometimes resulting in life- threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200-mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro , the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT c interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT c interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine, cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .) Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions (see PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions ). Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .) Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions . ) Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS : Drug Interactions .) Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Hypersensitivity Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Coadministration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on doseadjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under 'Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations'. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3- fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on doseadjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under 'Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations'. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine.

Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively.

The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ). This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action- Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale. Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology- Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale ( Malassezia ovale ) and Pityrosporum orbiculare ( M. furfur ) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ) . Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients- Patients should be advised of the following: \u2022 Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. \u2022 The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. \u2022 Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility- Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing Mothers- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use- Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of ketoconazole foam, 2% to women who are breastfeeding. In animal studies ketoconazole was found in milk following oral administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ketoconazole foam, 2% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ketoconazole foam, 2% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility In animal fertility studies in rats and dogs, administration of oral doses of ketoconazole between 3-day and 3-month periods resulted in infertility that was reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole foam, 2% in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 44 (7%) were from 12 to 17 years of age. [See Clinical Studies (14) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 107 (16%) were 65 years and over. Clinical trials of ketoconazole foam, 2% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or photo-carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole foam, 2%. In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice (18-months) and rats (24-months) at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic. The high dose in these studies was approximately 2.4 to 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential. In three in vivo assays (sister chromatid exchange in humans, dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice), ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential. In animal fertility studies, oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner. In females, oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) had no effect on fertility, while doses of 75 mg/kg (4.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites. In male rats, oral dosing at 200 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility. When administered for longer durations (up to 3 months), decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In male beagle dogs, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks (5.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) resulted in decreased sperm motility, decreased sperm count, increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes. These effects were reversed subsequent to withdrawal of treatment."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur ). This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4 times to 10 times per week for 6 months or in 33 patients who shampooed 2 times to 3 times per week for 3 months to 26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale . Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum , T. mentagrophytes , T. tonsurans , Microsporum canis , M. audouini , M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , C. tropicalis , Pityrosporum ovale ( Malassezia ovale ) and Pityrosporum orbiculare ( M. furfur ). Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ). Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema or shortness of breath should discontinue ketoconazole shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing Mothers There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when ketoconazole shampoo, 2% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Clinical Trials Experience In 11 double-blind trials in 264 patients using ketoconazole shampoo, 2% for the treatment of dandruff or seborrheic dermatitis, an increase in normal hair loss and irritation occurred in less than 1% of patients. In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4 times to 10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107) or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-marketing experience with ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: there have been reports of hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin and application site reactions.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of ketoconazole foam, 2% to women who are breastfeeding. In animal studies ketoconazole was found in milk following oral administration.

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons)."

In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice (18-months) and rats (24-months) at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic. The high dose in these studies was approximately 2.4 to 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential. In three in vivo assays (sister chromatid exchange in humans, dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice), ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential. In animal fertility studies, oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner. In females, oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) had no effect on fertility, while doses of 75 mg/kg (4.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites. In male rats, oral dosing at 200 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility. When administered for longer durations (up to 3 months), decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In male beagle dogs, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks (5.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) resulted in decreased sperm motility, decreased sperm count, increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) . This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale . Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale (Malassezia ovale) and Pityrosporum orbiculare (M. furfur) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ). Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients: Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue ketoconazole shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing mothers: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200-mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro , the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT c interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT c interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis , Coccidioides immitis , Histoplasma capsulatum , Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine, cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions .) Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Hypersensitivity Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Coadministration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations '. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

      "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under ' Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased '), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under ' Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations '. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale , but: this has not been proven."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Ketoconazole Cream, 2% is not for ophthalmic use. Ketoconazole Cream, 2% contains sodium sulfite anhydrous, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data]. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and a ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of ketoconazole foam, 2% to women who are breastfeeding. In animal studies ketoconazole was found in milk following oral administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ketoconazole foam, 2% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ketoconazole foam, 2% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility In animal fertility studies in rats and dogs, administration of oral doses of ketoconazole between 3-day and 3-month periods resulted in infertility that was reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1)] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole foam, 2% in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 44 (7%) were from 12 to 17 years of age. [See Clinical Studies (14) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 107 (16%) were 65 years and over. Clinical trials of ketoconazole foam, 2% did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently than younger subjects."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic or photo-carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole foam, 2%. In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice (18-months) and rats (24-months) at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic. The high dose in these studies was approximately 2.4 to 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential. In three in vivo assays (sister chromatid exchange in humans, dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice), ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential. In animal fertility studies, oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner. In females, oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) had no effect on fertility, while doses of 75 mg/kg (4.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites. In male rats, oral dosing at 200 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility. When administered for longer durations (up to 3 months), decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In male beagle dogs, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks (5.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) resulted in decreased sperm motility, decreased sperm count, increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes. These effects were reversed subsequent to withdrawal of treatment."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ). This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action- Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale. Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology- Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale ( Malassezia ovale ) and Pityrosporum orbiculare ( M. furfur ) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ) . Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients- Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility- Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing Mothers- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use- Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

If a patient shows no clinical improvement after the treatment period, the diagnosis should be redetermined."

      "WARNING Because ketoconazole tablets have been associated with serious adverse reactions (see WARNINGS section), ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Patients receiving this drug should be informed by the physician of the risk and should be closely monitored. See WARNINGS section. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may prolong QT intervals, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. See CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, and PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS sections."

    "description": [
      "Ketoconazole tablets, USP is a synthetic broad-spectrum antifungal agent available in scored white tablets, each containing 200 mg ketoconazole base for oral administration. Inactive ingredients are colloidal silicon dioxide, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate and methylcellulose. Ketoconazole is cis-1-acetyl-4-[4-[[2-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-ylmethyl)-1,3-dioxolan-4-yl] methoxyl]phenyl] piperazine and has the following structural formula: Ketoconazole is a white to slightly beige, odorless powder, soluble in acids, with a molecular weight of 531.44g/mol."
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QTc interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QTc interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration."
    ],
    "microbiology": [
      "Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Hypersensitivity Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug."

    "warnings": [
      "Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED'), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED'), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers Tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS.] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE KETOCONAZOLE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS'. Telithromycin: A multiple- dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that Cmax of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics alprazolam, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the Cmax and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When ketoconazole cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/mL. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/mL level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole cream, 2%. Microbiology Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not been proven."

Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether ketoconazole cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) . This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale . Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale (Malassezia ovale) and Pityrosporum orbiculare (M. furfur) .

      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients: Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue ketoconazole shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing mothers: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency.

In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-marketing experience with ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: there have been reports of hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but this has not yet been proven."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy: Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) . This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action: Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare (Malassezia furfur) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale . Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale (Malassezia ovale) and Pityrosporum orbiculare (M. furfur) .

Information for Patients Patients should be advised of the following: Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue ketoconazole shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose).

In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-marketing experience with ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: there have been reports of hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is a non-contagious infection of the skin caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ). This commensal organism is part of the normal skin flora. In susceptible individuals the condition is often recurrent and may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in restoration of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental skin exposure. The rate of recurrence of infection is variable. Ketoconazole was not detected in plasma in 39 patients who shampooed 4-10 times per week for 6 months, or in 33 patients who shampooed 2-3 times per week for 3-26 months (mean: 16 months). An exaggerated use washing test on the sensitive antecubital skin of 10 subjects twice daily for five consecutive days showed that the irritancy potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% was significantly less than that of 2.5% selenium sulfide shampoo. A human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study, and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 22 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. Mode of Action- Interpretations of in vivo studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated, but not proven, that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in tinea (pityriasis) versicolor is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum orbiculare ( Malassezia furfur ) and that the therapeutic effect in dandruff is due to the reduction of Pityrosporum ovale. Support for the therapeutic effect in tinea versicolor comes from a three-arm, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients who had moderately severe tinea (pityriasis) versicolor. Successful response rates in the primary efficacy population for each of both three-day and single-day regimens of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% were statistically significantly greater (73% and 69%, respectively) than a placebo regimen (5%). There had been mycological confirmation of fungal disease in all cases at baseline. Mycological clearing rates were 84% and 78%, respectively, for the three-day and one-day regimens of the 2% shampoo and 11% in the placebo regimen. While the differences in the rates of successful response between either of the two active treatments and placebo were statistically significant, the difference between the two active regimens was not. Microbiology- Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans, C. tropicalis, Pityrosporum ovale ( Malassezia ovale ) and Pityrosporum orbiculare ( M. furfur ) . Development of resistance by these microorganisms to ketoconazole has not been reported."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ) . Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients- Patients should be advised of the following: \u2022 Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. \u2022 The following have been reported with the use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, removal of the curl from permanently waved hair, itching, skin burning sensation and contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions. \u2022 Patients who develop allergic reactions, such as generalized rash, skin reactions, severe swelling, angioedema, or shortness of breath should discontinue Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% and contact their physician immediately. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility- Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C - There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing Mothers- There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when Ketoconazole Shampoo, 2% is administered to a nursing woman.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is indicated for the treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor caused by or presumed to be caused by Pityrosporum orbiculare (also known as Malassezia furfur or M. orbiculare ). Note: Tinea (pityriasis) versicolor may give rise to hyperpigmented or hypopigmented patches on the trunk which may extend to the neck, arms and upper thighs. Treatment of the infection may not immediately result in normalization of pigment to the affected sites. Normalization of pigment following successful therapy is variable and may take months, depending on individual skin type and incidental sun exposure. Although tinea versicolor is not contagious, it may recur because the organism that causes the disease is part of the normal skin flora."

      "PRECAUTIONS Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported during post-marketing use of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%. If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Information for Patients Patients should be advised of the following: 1. Ketoconazole shampoo, 2% may be irritating to mucous membranes of the eyes and contact with this area should be avoided. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies to assess the carcinogenic potential of ketoconazole shampoo, 2% have not been conducted. A long-term feeding study of ketoconazole in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg were not genotoxic. The Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects: Pregnancy Category C: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. In humans, ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (a dose 10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. Nursing mothers There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in nursing women. Ketoconazole is not detected in plasma after chronic shampooing on the scalp. Caution should be exercised when ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in children have not been established."

In three open-label safety trials in which 41 patients shampooed 4-10 times weekly for six months, the following adverse experiences each occurred once: abnormal hair texture, scalp pustules, mild dryness of the skin, and itching. As with other shampoos, oiliness and dryness of hair and scalp have been reported. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in which patients with tinea versicolor were treated with either a single application of ketoconazole shampoo, 2%, (n=106), a daily application for three consecutive days (n=107), or placebo (n=105), drug-related adverse events occurred in 5 (5%), 7 (7%) and 4 (4%) of patients, respectively. The only events that occurred in more than one patient in any one of the three treatment groups were pruritus, application site reaction, and dry skin; none of these events occurred in more than 3% of the patients in any one of the three groups. Post-marketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not possible to reliably estimate their frequency. The following adverse drug reactions have been identified during post-marketing experience with ketoconazole shampoo, 2%: there have been reports of hair discoloration and abnormal hair texture, itching, skin burning sensation, contact dermatitis, hypersensitivity, angioedema, alopecia, rash, urticaria, skin irritation, dry skin, and application site reactions."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale , but: this has not been proven."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary There are no available data on ketoconazole foam, 2% use in pregnant women to identify a drug\u2011associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. No reproductive studies in animals have been performed with ketoconazole foam, 2%. In animal reproduction studies with pregnant mice, rats and rabbits both embryotoxic and developmental effects (structural abnormalities) were observed following oral dosing of ketoconazole during organogenesis. Assuming equivalent systemic absorption of topical and oral ketoconazole doses and an ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 160 mg ketoconazole), embryotoxic effects were observed at 0.8 to 2.4 times the MRHD and developmental effects were observed at 4.8 times the MRHD [see Data ] . The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data The animal multiples of human exposure calculations are based on body surface area (BSA) comparisons of oral doses administered to animals and an ketoconazole foam, 2% maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 8 grams (equivalent to 2.67 mg ketoconazole/kg/day for a 60 kg individual or 98.8 mg ketoconazole/m 2 /day). Embryofetal development studies have been conducted in mice, rats and rabbits with orally administered ketoconazole. When orally administered to mice on gestational days 6 through 18 (covering the period of organogenesis), ketoconazole was embryotoxic (25 mg/kg and higher; 0.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) with a high incidence of resorptions, increased number of stillbirths and delayed parturition. Delays in maturation were also observed. There was no evidence of maternal toxicity or malformations at up to 50 mg/kg (1.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). No treatment related developmental effects were observed at 10 mg/kg (0.3 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In the presence of maternal toxicity in rats, orally administered ketoconazole was both embryotoxic (40 mg/kg and higher; 2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including increased resorbed fetuses and stillbirths, and teratogenic (80 mg/kg and higher; 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons), including syndactylia, oligodactylia, waved ribs and cleft palate. Additionally, 100 mg/kg (6 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) ketoconazole orally administered on a single day during gestation (gestational days 9 through 12) was embryotoxic (increased resorptions). This same oral dose given on gestation day 12, 13, 14 or 15 induced external malformations including cleft palate, micromelia and digital anomalies (brachydactyly, ectrodactyly, syndactyly). In pregnant rabbits orally administered ketoconazole, evidence of embryotoxicity (increased resorptions) was observed at 10 mg/kg (1.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher and an increased incidence of skeletal abnormalities was observed at 40 mg/kg (4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is no information available on the presence of ketoconazole in human milk, or the effects on the breastfed child, or the effects on milk production after topical application of ketoconazole foam, 2% to women who are breastfeeding. In animal studies ketoconazole was found in milk following oral administration. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ketoconazole foam, 2% and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from ketoconazole foam, 2% or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Infertility In animal fertility studies in rats and dogs, administration of oral doses of ketoconazole between 3-day and 3-month periods resulted in infertility that was reversible [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ]. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole foam, 2% in pediatric patients less than 12 years of age have not been established. Of the 672 subjects treated with ketoconazole foam, 2% in the clinical trials, 44 (7%) were from 12 to 17 years of age.

In oral carcinogenicity studies in mice (18-months) and rats (24-months) at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day ketoconazole was not carcinogenic. The high dose in these studies was approximately 2.4 to 4.8 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons. In a bacterial reverse mutation assay, ketoconazole did not express any mutagenic potential. In three in vivo assays (sister chromatid exchange in humans, dominant lethal and micronucleus tests in mice), ketoconazole did not exhibit any genotoxic potential. In animal fertility studies, oral ketoconazole impaired both male and female fertility in rats in a dose and duration dependent manner. In females, oral doses up to 40 mg/kg (2.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) had no effect on fertility, while doses of 75 mg/kg (4.5 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) and higher decreased the pregnancy rate and number of implantation sites. In male rats, oral dosing at 200 mg/kg/day (12 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days decreased fertility and 400 mg/kg/day (24 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) for three days resulted in a complete loss of fertility. When administered for longer durations (up to 3 months), decreased fertility in male rats was observed at doses as low as 24 mg/kg/day (1.4 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons). In male beagle dogs, an oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day ketoconazole for up to 4 weeks (5.2 times the MRHD based on BSA comparisons) resulted in decreased sperm motility, decreased sperm count, increased abnormal sperm and atrophy of the testes.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES The safety and efficacy of ketoconazole foam, 2% were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial in subjects 12 years and older with mild to severe seborrheic dermatitis. In the trial, 427 subjects received ketoconazole foam, 2% and 420 subjects received vehicle foam. Subjects applied ketoconazole foam, 2% or vehicle foam twice daily for 4 weeks to affected areas on the face, scalp, and/or chest. The overall disease severity in terms of erythema, scaling, and induration was assessed at Baseline and week 4 on a 5-point Investigator\u2019s Static Global Assessment (ISGA) scale. Treatment success was defined as achieving a Week 4 (end of treatment) ISGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (majority of lesions have individual scores for scaling, erythema, and induration that averages 1 [minimal or faint]) and at least two grades of improvement from baseline. The results are presented in Table 2. The database was not large enough to assess whether there were differences in effects in age, gender, or race subgroups. Table 2: Efficacy Results Number of Subjects Ketoconazole foam, 2% N = 427 n (%) Vehicle Foam N = 420 n (%) Subjects Achieving Treatment Success 239 (56%) 176 (42%)"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY When Ketoconazole Cream, 2% was applied dermally to intact or abraded skin of Beagle dogs for 28 consecutive days at a dose of 80 mg, there were no detectable plasma levels using an assay method having a lower detection limit of 2 ng/ml. After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum ; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis ; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare) . Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale , but: this has not been proven."

      "PRECAUTIONS General If a reaction suggesting sensitivity or chemical irritation should occur, use of the medication should be discontinued. Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

Structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H 2 -receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro , the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QT C interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QT C interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis , Coccidioides immitis , Histoplasma capsulatum , Paracoccidioides brasiliensis ."

Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with lurasidone is contraindicated since it may result in an increase in lurasidone exposure and the potential for serious adverse reactions. (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated (see PRECAUTIONS: Drug Interactions ). Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets are contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Hypersensitivity Ketoconazole tablets are contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole tablets treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Coadministration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, lurasidone, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g., acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4- metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under 'Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations' Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95% Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs; thus, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics Lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, them aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2 fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3 fold and 10.9 fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal Muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5 fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18 month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24 month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1x (mouse) or 2x (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m 2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g., acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g., aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased'), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4- metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression [See CONTRAINDICATIONS .] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under 'Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations' Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that C max of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95% Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs; thus, the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics Lurasidone, alprazolam, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone The increase in plasma concentrations of lurasidone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious side effects (See CONTRAINDICATIONS ). Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, them aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2 fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the C max and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3 fold and 10.9 fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal Muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5 fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours."

      "Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison)."

After a single topical application to the chest, back and arms of normal volunteers, systemic absorption of ketoconazole was not detected at the 5 ng/ml level in blood over a 72-hour period. Two dermal irritancy studies, a human sensitization test, a phototoxicity study and a photoallergy study conducted in 38 male and 62 female volunteers showed no contact sensitization of the delayed hypersensitivity type, no irritation, no phototoxicity and no photoallergenic potential due to Ketoconazole Cream, 2%. Microbiology: Ketoconazole is a broad spectrum synthetic antifungal agent which inhibits the in vitro growth of the following common dermatophytes and yeasts by altering the permeability of the cell membrane: dermatophytes: Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, Microsporum canis, M. audouini, M. gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum; yeasts: Candida albicans , Malassezia ovale (Pityrosporum ovale) and C. tropicalis; and the organism responsible for tinea versicolor, Malassezia furfur (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Only those organisms listed in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE Section have been proven to be clinically affected. Development of resistance to ketoconazole has not been reported. Mode of Action: In vitro studies suggest that ketoconazole impairs the synthesis of ergosterol, which is a vital component of fungal cell membranes. It is postulated that the therapeutic effect of ketoconazole in seborrheic dermatitis is due to the reduction of M. ovale, but: this has not been proven."

Hepatitis (1:10,000 reported incidence) and, at high doses, lowered testosterone and ACTH induced corticosteroid serum levels have been seen with orally administered ketoconazole; these effects have not been seen with topical ketoconazole. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A long-term feeding study in Swiss Albino mice and in Wistar rats showed no evidence of oncogenic activity. The dominant lethal mutation test in male and female mice revealed that single oral doses of ketoconazole as high as 80 mg/kg produced no mutation in any stage of germ cell development. The Ames' Salmonella microsomal activator assay was also negative. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given orally in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day, (10 times the maximum recommended human oral dose). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, which was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers It is not known whether Ketoconazole Cream, 2% administered topically could result in sufficient systemic absorption to produce detectable quantities in breast milk. Nevertheless, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption Ketoconazole is a weak dibasic agent and thus requires acidity for dissolution and absorption. Mean peak plasma concentrations of approximately 3.5 mcg/mL are reached within 1 to 2 hours, following oral administration of a single 200 mg dose taken with a meal. Oral bioavailability is maximal when the tablets are taken with a meal. Absorption of ketoconazole tablets is reduced in subjects with reduced gastric acidity, such as subjects taking medications known as acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) and gastric acid secretion suppressors (e.g. H2-receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors) or subjects with achlorhydria caused by certain diseases. (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Absorption of ketoconazole under fasted conditions in these subjects is increased when ketoconazole tablets are administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola). After pretreatment with omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, the bioavailability of a single 200 mg dose of ketoconazole under fasted conditions was decreased to 17% of the bioavailability of ketoconazole administered alone. When ketoconazole was administered with non-diet cola after pretreatment with omeprazole, the bioavailability was 65% of that after administration of ketoconazole alone. Distribution In vitro, the plasma protein binding is about 99% mainly to the albumin fraction. Ketoconazole is widely distributed into tissues; however, only a negligible proportion reaches the cerebrospinal fluid. Metabolism Following absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, ketoconazole tablets are converted into several inactive metabolites. In vitro studies have shown that CYP3A4 is the major enzyme involved in the metabolism of ketoconazole. The major identified metabolic pathways are oxidation and degradation of the imidazole and piperazine rings, by hepatic microsomal enzymes. In addition, oxidative O-dealkylation and aromatic hydroxylation does occur. Ketoconazole has not been demonstrated to induce its own metabolism. Elimination Elimination from plasma is biphasic with a half-life of 2 hours during the first 10 hours and 8 hours thereafter. Approximately 13% of the dose is excreted in the urine, of which 2 to 4% is unchanged drug. The major route of excretion is through the bile into the intestinal tract with about 57% being excreted in the feces. Special Populations Patients with Hepatic or Renal Impairment In patients with hepatic or renal impairment, the overall pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole was not significantly different when compared with healthy subjects. Pediatric Patients Limited pharmacokinetic data are available on the use of ketoconazole tablets in the pediatric population. Measurable ketoconazole plasma concentrations have been observed in pre-term infants (single or daily doses of 3 to 10 mg/kg) and in pediatric patients 5 months of age and older (daily doses of 3 to 13 mg/kg) when the drug was administered as a suspension, tablet or crushed tablet. Limited data suggest that absorption may be greater when the drug is administered as a suspension compared to a crushed tablet. Conditions that raise gastric pH may lower or prevent absorption (See Section PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS). Maximum plasma concentrations occurred 1 to 2 hours after dosing and were in the same general range as those seen in adults who received a 200 to 400 mg dose. Electrocardiogram Pre-clinical electrophysiological studies have shown that ketoconazole inhibits the rapidly activating component of the cardiac delayed rectifier potassium current, prolongs the action potential duration, and may prolong the QTc interval. Data from some clinical PK/PD studies and drug interaction studies suggest that oral dosing with ketoconazole at 200 mg twice daily for 3 to 7 days can result in an increase of the QTc interval: a mean maximum increase of about 6 to 12 msec was seen at ketoconazole peak plasma concentrations about 1 to 4 hours after ketoconazole administration. MICROBIOLOGY Mechanism of Action Ketoconazole blocks the synthesis of ergosterol, a key component of the fungal cell membrane, through the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 dependent enzyme lanosterol 14\u03b1-demethylase responsible for the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol in the fungal cell membrane. This results in an accumulation of methylated sterol precursors and a depletion of ergosterol within the cell membrane thus weakening the structure and function of the fungal cell membrane. Activity In Vitro & In Vivo Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg are active against clinical infections with Blastomyces dermatitidis, Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, Paracoccidioides brasiliensis."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "Ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Ketoconazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following systemic fungal infections in patients who have failed or who are intolerant to other therapies: blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, histoplasmosis, chromomycosis, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used for fungal meningitis because it penetrates poorly into the cerebrospinal fluid."

    "contraindications": [
      "Drug Interactions Coadministration of a number of CYP3A4 substrates such as dofetilide, quinidine cisapride and pimozide is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. Coadministration with ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs and may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects to such an extent that a potentially serious adverse reaction may occur. For example, increased plasma concentrations of some of these drugs can lead to QT prolongation and sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias including occurrences of torsades de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Additionally, the following other drugs are contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets: methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine, ergotamine, methylergometrine, irinotecan, lurasidone, oral midazolam, alprazolam, triazolam, felodipine, nisoldipine, ranolazine, tolvaptan, eplerenone, lovastatin, simvastatin and colchicine. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Enhanced Sedation Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam, oral triazolam or alprazolam has resulted in elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets with oral triazolam, oral midazolam or alprazolam is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Myopathy Coadministration of CYP3A4 metabolized HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as simvastatin, and lovastatin is contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Ergotism Concomitant administration of ergot alkaloids such as dihydroergotamine and ergotamine with ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated. (See PRECAUTIONS: DRUG INTERACTIONS.) Liver Disease The use of ketoconazole tablets is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver disease. Hypersensitivity Ketoconazole tablets USP, 200 mg is contraindicated in patients who have shown hypersensitivity to the drug."

    "warnings": [
      "Because of the serious adverse reactions that have been reported in association with ketoconazole, including fatal hepatotoxicity, ketoconazole tablets are not indicated for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Ketoconazole tablets should be used only when other effective antifungal therapy is not available or tolerated and the potential benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risks. Hepatotoxicity Serious hepatotoxicity, including cases with a fatal outcome or requiring liver transplantation, has occurred with the use of oral ketoconazole. Some patients had no obvious risk factors for liver disease. Serious hepatotoxicity was reported both by patients receiving high doses for short treatment durations and by patients receiving low doses for long durations. The hepatic injury has usually, but not always, been reversible upon discontinuation of ketoconazole treatment. Cases of hepatitis have been reported in children. At baseline, obtain laboratory tests (such as SGGT, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, total bilirubin (TBL), Prothrombin Time (PT), International Normalization Ratio (INR), and testing for viral hepatitides). Patients should be advised against alcohol consumption while on treatment. If possible, use of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs should be avoided in patients receiving ketoconazole tablets. Prompt recognition of liver injury is essential. During the course of treatment, serum ALT should be monitored weekly for the duration of treatment. If ALT values increase to a level above the upper limit of normal or 30 percent above baseline, or if the patient develops symptoms, ketoconazole treatment should be interrupted and a full set of liver tests should be obtained. Liver tests should be repeated to ensure normalization of values. Hepatotoxicity has been reported with restarting oral ketoconazole (rechallenge). If it is decided to restart oral ketoconazole, monitor the patient frequently to detect any recurring liver injury from the drug. QT Prolongation and Drug Interactions Leading to QT Prolongation Ketoconazole can prolong the QT interval. Co-administration of the following drugs with ketoconazole is contraindicated: dofetilide, quinidine, pimozide, cisapride, methadone, disopyramide, dronedarone, ranolazine. Ketoconazole can cause elevated plasma concentrations of these drugs which may prolong the QT interval, sometimes resulting in life-threatening ventricular dysrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. Adrenal Insufficiency Ketoconazole tablets decrease adrenal corticosteroid secretion at doses of 400 mg and higher. This effect is not shared with other azoles. The recommended dose of 200 mg to 400 mg daily should not be exceeded. Adrenal function should be monitored in patients with adrenal insufficiency or with borderline adrenal function and in patients under prolonged periods of stress (major surgery, intensive care, etc.). Adverse Reactions Associated with Unapproved Uses Ketoconazole has been used in high doses for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and for Cushing's syndrome when other treatment options have failed. The safety and effectiveness of ketoconazole have not been established in these settings and the use of ketoconazole for these indications is not approved by FDA. In a clinical trial involving 350 patients with metastatic prostatic cancer, eleven deaths were reported within two weeks of starting treatment with high doses of ketoconazole tablets (1200 mg/day). It is not possible to ascertain from the information available whether death was related to ketoconazole therapy or adrenal insufficiency in these patients with serious underlying disease. Hepatoxicity, including fatal cases and cases requiring liver transplantation, have been reported in patients who received ketoconazole for treatment of onychomycosis, cutaneous dermatophyte infections, or Candida infections. Hypersensitivity Anaphylaxis has been reported after the first dose. Several cases of hypersensitivity reactions including urticaria have also been reported."

    "precautions": [
      "General Ketoconazole tablets have been demonstrated to lower serum testosterone. Once therapy with ketoconazole tablets has been discontinued, serum testosterone levels return to baseline values. Testosterone levels are impaired with doses of 800 mg per day and abolished by 1600 mg per day. Clinical manifestations of decreased testosterone concentrations may include gynecomastia, impotence and oligospermia. Information for Patients Patients should be instructed to report any signs and symptoms which may suggest liver dysfunction so that appropriate biochemical testing can be done. Such signs and symptoms may include unusual fatigue, anorexia, nausea and/or vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, dark urine or pale stools (see WARNINGS section). Drug Interactions Ketoconazole is mainly metabolized through CYP3A4. Other substances that either share this metabolic pathway or modify CYP3A4 activity may influence the pharmacokinetics of ketoconazole. Similarly, ketoconazole may modify the pharmacokinetics of other substances that share this metabolic pathway. Ketoconazole is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor and a P-glycoprotein inhibitor. When using concomitant medication, the corresponding label should be consulted for information on the route of metabolism and the possible need to adjust dosages. Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. The relevance of the results from these studies in pediatric patients is unknown. Drugs that may decrease ketoconazole plasma concentrations Drugs that reduce the gastric acidity (e.g. acid neutralizing medicines such as aluminum hydroxide, or acid secretion suppressors such as H2-receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) impair the absorption of ketoconazole from ketoconazole tablets. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets: Ketoconazole tablets should be administered with an acidic beverage (such as non-diet cola) upon co-treatment with drugs reducing gastric acidity. Acid neutralizing medicines (e.g. aluminum hydroxide) should be administered at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after the intake of ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 may decrease the bioavailability of ketoconazole to such an extent that efficacy may be reduced. Examples include: Antibacterials: isoniazid, rifabutin (see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED'), rifampicin. Anticonvulsants: carbamazepine (see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY HAVE THEIR PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS INCREASED'), phenytoin. Antivirals: efavirenz, nevirapine. Therefore, administration of potent enzyme inducers of CYP3A4 with ketoconazole tablets is not recommended. The use of these drugs should be avoided from 2 weeks before and during treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the risk of potentially reduced ketoconazole efficacy. Upon coadministration, the antifungal activity should be monitored and the ketoconazole tablets dose increased as deemed necessary. Drugs that may increase ketoconazole plasma concentrations Potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. antivirals such as ritonavir, ritonavir-boosted darunavir and ritonavir-boosted fosamprenavir) may increase the bioavailability of ketoconazole. These drugs should be used with caution when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Patients who must take ketoconazole tablets concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged pharmacologic effects of ketoconazole, and the ketoconazole tablets dose should be decreased as deemed necessary. When appropriate, ketoconazole plasma concentrations should be measured. Drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole Ketoconazole can inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 and can inhibit the drug transport by P-glycoprotein, which may result in increased plasma concentrations of these drugs and/or their active metabolite(s) when they are administered with ketoconazole. These elevated plasma concentrations may increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs. CYP3A4-metabolized drugs known to prolong the QT interval may be contraindicated with ketoconazole tablets, since the combination may lead to ventricular tachyarrhythmias, including occurrences of torsade de pointes, a potentially fatal arrhythmia. Examples of drugs that may have their plasma concentrations increased by ketoconazole presented by drug class with advice regarding coadministration with ketoconazole tablets: Drug Class Contraindicated Not Recommended Use with Caution Comments Under no circumstances should the drug be coadministered with ketoconazole tablets, and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole. The use of the drug should be avoided during and up to one week after discontinuation of treatment with ketoconazole tablets, unless the benefits outweigh the potentially increased risks of side effects. If coadministration cannot be avoided, clinical monitoring for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug is recommended, and its dosage should be reduced or interrupted as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Careful monitoring is recommended when the drug is coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Upon coadministration, patients should be monitored closely for signs or symptoms of increased or prolonged effects or side effects of the interacting drug, and its dosage should be reduced as deemed necessary. When appropriate, plasma concentrations should be measured. The label of the coadministered drug should be consulted for information on dose adjustment and adverse effects. Alpha Blockers tamsulosin Analgesics methadone alfentanil, buprenorphine IV and sublingual, fentanyl, oxycodone, sufentanil Methadone: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of methadone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes, or respiratory or CNS depression. [See CONTRAINDICATIONS.] Fentanyl: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of fentanyl when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal respiratory depression. Sufentanil: No human pharmacokinetic data of an interaction with ketoconazole are available. In vitro data suggest that sufentanil is metabolized by CYP3A4 and so potentially increased sufentanil plasma concentrations would be expected when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets. Antiarrhythmics disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine digoxin Disopyramide, dofetilide, dronedarone, quinidine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of these drugs when coadministered with ketoconazole may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Digoxin: Rare cases of elevated plasma concentrations of digoxin have been reported. It is not clear whether this was due to the combination of therapy. It is, therefore, advisable to monitor digoxin concentrations in patients receiving ketoconazole. Antibacterials rifabutin telithromycin Rifabutin: see also under 'DRUGS THAT MAY DECREASE KETOCONAZOLE PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS'. Telithromycin: A multiple-dose interaction study with ketoconazole showed that Cmax of telithromycin was increased by 51% and AUC by 95%. Anticoagulants and Antiplatelet Drugs rivaroxaban cilostazol, coumarins, dabigatran Cilostazol: Concomitant administration of single doses of cilostazol 100 mg and ketoconazole 400 mg approximately doubled cilostazol concentrations and altered (increase/decrease) the concentrations of the active metabolites of cilostazol. Coumarins: Ketoconazole may enhance the anticoagulant effect of coumarin-like drugs, thus the anticoagulant effect should be carefully titrated and monitored. Dabigatran: In patients with moderate renal impairment (CrCL 50 mL/min to \u2264 80 mL/min), consider reducing the dose of dabigatran to 75 mg twice daily when it is coadministered with ketoconazole. Anticonvulsants carbamazepine Carbamazepine: In vivo studies have demonstrated an increase in plasma carbamazepine concentrations in subjects concomitantly receiving ketoconazole. In addition, the bioavailability of ketoconazole may be reduced by carbamazepine. Antidiabetics repaglinide, saxagliptin Antihelmintics and Antiprotozoals praziquantel Antimigraine Drugs ergot alkaloids, such as dihydroergotamine, ergometrine (ergonovine), ergotamine, methylergometrine (methylergonovine) eletriptan Ergot alkaloids: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ergot alkaloids when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of ergotism, i.e., a risk for vasospasm potentially leading to cerebral ischemia and/or ischemia of the extremities. Eletriptan: Eletriptan should be used with caution with ketoconazole, and specifically, should not be used within at least 72 hours of treatment with ketoconazole. Antineoplastics irinotecan dasatinib, lapatinib, nilotinib bortezomib, busulphan, docetaxel, erlotinib, imatinib, ixabepilone, paclitaxel, trimetrexate, vinca alkaloids Irinotecan: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of irinotecan when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Docetaxel: In the presence of ketoconazole, the clearance of docetaxel in cancer patients was shown to decrease by 50%. Antipsychotics, Anxiolytics and Hypnotics alprazolam, lurasidone, oral midazolam, pimozide, triazolam aripiprazole, buspirone, haloperidol, midazolam IV, quetiapine, ramelteon, risperidone Alprazolam, midazolam, triazolam: Coadministration of ketoconazole tablets with oral midazolam or triazolam, or alprazolam may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of these drugs. This may potentiate and prolong hypnotic and sedative effects, especially with repeated dosing or chronic administration of these agents. Pimozide: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of pimozide when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. Aripiprazole: Coadministration of ketoconazole (200 mg/day for 14 days) with a 15 mg single dose of aripiprazole increased the AUC of aripiprazole and its active metabolite by 63% and 77%, respectively. The effect of a higher ketoconazole dose (400 mg/day) has not been studied. When ketoconazole is given concomitantly with aripiprazole, the aripiprazole dose should be reduced to one-half of the recommended dose. Buspirone: Ketoconazole is expected to inhibit buspirone metabolism and increase plasma concentrations of buspirone. If a patient has been titrated to a stable dosage on buspirone, a dose reduction of buspirone may be necessary to avoid adverse events attributable to buspirone or diminished anxiolytic activity. Antivirals indinavir, maraviroc, saquinavir Beta Blockers nadolol Calcium Channel Blockers felodipine, nisoldipine other dihydropyridines, verapamil Calcium channel blockers can have a negative inotropic effect which may be additive to those of ketoconazole. The potential increase in plasma concentrations of calcium channel blockers when co-administered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of edema and congestive heart failure. Dihydropyridines: Concomitant administration of ketoconazole tablets may cause several-fold increases in plasma concentrations of dihydropyridines. Cardiovascular Drugs, Miscellaneous ranolazine aliskiren, bosentan Ranolazine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of ranolazine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Bosentan: Coadministration of bosentan 125 mg twice daily and ketoconazole, increased the plasma concentrations of bosentan by approximately 2-fold in normal volunteers. No dose adjustment of bosentan is necessary, but patients should be monitored for increased pharmacologic effects and adverse reactions of bosentan. Diuretics eplerenone The potential increase in plasma concentrations of eplerenone when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of hyperkalemia and hypotension. Gastrointestinal Drugs cisapride aprepitant Cisapride: Oral ketoconazole potently inhibits the metabolism of cisapride resulting in a mean eight-fold increase in AUC of cisapride, which can lead to serious cardiovascular events including QT prolongation. Immunosuppressants everolimus, rapamycin (also known as sirolimus), temsirolimus budesonide, ciclesonide, cyclosporine, dexamethasone, fluticasone, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus Rapamycin (sirolimus): Ketoconazole tablets 200 mg daily for 10 days increased the Cmax and AUC of a single 5 mg dose of sirolimus by 4.3-fold and 10.9-fold, respectively in 23 healthy subjects. Fluticasone: Coadministration of fluticasone propionate and ketoconazole is not recommended unless the potential benefit to the patient outweighs the risk of systemic corticosteroid side effects. Lipid Regulating Drugs lovastatin, simvastatin atorvastatin The potential increase in plasma concentrations of atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of skeletal muscle toxicity, including rhabdomyolysis. Respiratory Drugs salmeterol Urological Drugs fesoterodine, sildenafil, solifenacin, tadalafil, tolterodine, vardenafil Vardenafil: A single dose of 5 mg of vardenafil should not be exceeded when coadministered with ketoconazole. Other colchicine, in subjects with renal or hepatic impairment; tolvaptan colchicine alcohol, cinacalcet Colchicine: The potential increase in plasma concentrations of colchicine when coadministered with ketoconazole tablets may increase the risk of potentially fatal adverse events. Tolvaptan: Ketoconazole 200 mg administered with tolvaptan increased tolvaptan exposure by 5-fold. Larger doses would be expected to produce larger increases in tolvaptan exposure. There is not adequate experience to define the dose adjustment that would be needed to allow safe use of tolvaptan with strong CYP3A inhibitors such as ketoconazole. Alcohol: Exceptional cases have been reported of a disulfiram-like reaction to alcohol, characterized by flushing, rash, peripheral edema, nausea and headache. All symptoms completely resolved within a few hours. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Ketoconazole did not show any signs of mutagenic potential when evaluated using the dominant lethal mutation test or the Ames Salmonella microsomal activator assay. Ketoconazole was not carcinogenic in an 18-month, oral study in Swiss albino mice or a 24-month oral carcinogenicity study in Wistar rats at dose levels of 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg/day. The high dose in these studies was approximately 1\u00d7 (mouse) or 2\u00d7 (rat) the clinical dose in humans based on a mg/m2 comparison. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects Pregnancy Category C Ketoconazole has been shown to be teratogenic (syndactylia and oligodactylia) in the rat when given in the diet at 80 mg/kg/day (2 times the maximum recommended human dose, based on body surface area comparisons). However, these effects may be related to maternal toxicity, evidence of which also was seen at this and higher dose levels. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women. Ketoconazole tablets should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects Ketoconazole has also been found to be embryotoxic in the rat when given in the diet at doses higher than 80 mg/kg during the first trimester of gestation. In addition, dystocia (difficult labor) was noted in rats administered oral ketoconazole during the third trimester of gestation. This occurred when ketoconazole was administered at doses higher than 10 mg/kg (about one fourth the maximum human dose, based on body surface area comparison). Nursing Mothers Ketoconazole has been shown to be excreted in the milk. Mothers who are under treatment with ketoconazole tablets should not breast feed. Pediatric Use Ketoconazole tablets have not been systematically studied in children of any age, and essentially no information is available on children under 2 years. Ketoconazole tablets should not be used in pediatric patients unless the potential benefit outweighs the risks."
