The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm x 14 cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: purified water, glycerin, sorbitol, polyacrylic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium polyacrylate, propylene glycol, urea, kaolin, tartaric acid, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, edetate disodium, methylparaben, and propylparaben. molecule"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

      "Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch 5% performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours. Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value <0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Risk of Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue lidocaine patch 5% and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen. Accidental Exposure in Children Even a used lidocaine patch 5% contains a large amount of lidocaine (at least 665 mg). The potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used lidocaine patch 5%, although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated. It is important for patients to store and dispose of lidocaine patch 5% out of the reach of children, pets, and others (see HANDLING AND DISPOSAL). Excessive Dosing Excessive dosing by applying lidocaine patch 5% to larger areas or for longer than the recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood concentrations, leading to serious adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions). Lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 mcg/mL. The blood concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination. Longer duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller patients, or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of lidocaine. With recommended dosing of lidocaine patch 5%, the average peak blood concentration is about 0.13 mcg/mL, but concentrations higher than 0.25 mcg/mL have been observed in some individuals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hepatic Disease Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally. Allergic Reactions Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. However, lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain. Non-intact Skin Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption. Lidocaine patch 5% is only recommended for use on intact skin. External Heat Sources Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over lidocaine patch 5% is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma lidocaine levels. Eye Exposure The contact of lidocaine patch 5% with eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns. Information for Patients Methemoglobinemia Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue. Drug Interactions Antiarrhythmic Drugs Lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Local Anesthetics When lidocaine patch 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered. Drugs That May Cause Methemoglobinemia When Used with Lidocaine Patch 5% Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics: Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitric oxide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, tetracaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid, sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants Phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, quinine, sulfasalazine Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Mutagenesis Lidocaine HCl is not mutagenic in Salmonella/mammalian microsome test nor clastogenic in chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes and mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effect of lidocaine patch 5% on fertility has not been studied. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in pregnancy. Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, lidocaine patch 5% should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in labor and delivery. Lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should lidocaine patch 5% be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered. Nursing Mothers Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in nursing mothers. Lidocaine is excreted in human milk, and the milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4. Caution should be exercised when lidocaine patch 5% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

These reactions are generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within a few minutes to hours. Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm, pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Other Adverse Events Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including: Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence, taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and tremor. Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine patch 5% are unlikely, due to the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold, or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest."

If there is any suspicion of lidocaine overdose (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions), drug blood concentration should be checked. The management of overdose includes close monitoring, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdose with lidocaine. In the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion, evaluation of symptoms of toxicity should include consideration of other etiologies for the clinical effects, or overdosage from other sources of lidocaine or other local anesthetics. The oral LD 50 of lidocaine HCl is 459 (346 to 773) mg/kg (as the salt) in non-fasted female rats and 214 (159 to 324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats, which are equivalent to roughly 4000 mg and 2000 mg, respectively, in a 60 to 70 kg man based on the equivalent surface area dosage conversion factors between species."

      "WARNINGS/PRECAUTIONS: WARNINGS: CONCERNS RELATED TO ADVERSE EFFECTS: Methemoglobinemia: Has been reported with local anesthetics; clinically significant methemoglobinemia requires immediate treatment along with discontinuation of the anesthetic and other oxidizing agents. Onset may be immediate or delayed (hours) after anesthetic exposure. Patients with G6PD deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites, or infants <6 months of age are more susceptible and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (including pale, gray, or blue-colored skin (cyanosis), headache, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue). WARNINGS: For external use only. Not for ophthalmic use. Stop use and ask a doctor if condition worsens or symptoms last more than 7 days or clear up and occur again within a few days. Do not apply to wounds or damaged skin. Do not use in large quantities, particularly over raw surfaces or blistered areas. If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away. Keep out of reach of children. Topical formulations of lidocaine may be absorbed to a greater extent through mucous membranes and abraded, fissured or irritated skin than through intact skin. Product should not be ingested or applied into the mouth, inside of the nose or in the eyes. Product should not be used in the ears. Any situation where lidocaine penetrates beyond the tympanic membrane into the middle ear is contraindicated because of ototoxicity associated with lidocaine observed in animals when instilled in the middle ear. Product should not come into contact with the eye or be applied into the eye because of the risk of severe eye irritation and the loss of eye surface sensation, which reduces protective reflexes and can lead to corneal irritation and possibly abrasion. If eye contact occurs, rinse out the eye immediately with saline or water and protect the eye surface until sensation is restored. PRECAUTIONS: If irritation or sensitivity occurs or infection appears, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. If extensive areas are treated, the possibility of systemic absorption exists. Systemic absorption of topical steroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestation of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of potent topical steroids applied to a large surface area, or under an occlusive dressing, should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. If noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of the HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionately larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. If irritation develops, topical steroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Mechanism of Action: Product releases lidocaine to stabilize the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby affecting local anesthetic action. Hydrocortisone acetate providesrelief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid responsive dermatoses. Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration, and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation of the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver, and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage, and conjungation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites, and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent of drug concentration, and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid-glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be the threshold for convulsive activity. The extent of percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids is determined by many factors including the vehicle, the integrity of the epidermal barrier, and the use of occlusive dressings. Topical corticosteroids can be absorbed from normal intact skin. Inflammation and/or other disease processes in the skin increase percutaneous absorption. Occlusive dressings substantially increase the percutaneous absorption of topical corticosteroids. Thus, occlusive dressings may be a valuable therapeutic adjunct for treatment of resistant dermatoses. Once absorbed through the skin, topical corticosteroids are handled through pharmacokinetic pathways similar to systemically administered corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are bound to plasma protein in varying degrees. Corticosteroids are metabolized primarily in the liver and are then excreted by the kidneys. Some of the topical corticosteroids and their metabolites are also excreted into the bile."

If excessive irritation and significant worsening occur, discontinue use and seek the advice of your physician. Product and topical lidocaine should be used cautiously in those with impaired liver function, as well as the very ill or very elderly and those with significant liver disease. Product should be used with caution in patients receiving antiarrhythmic drugs of Class I since the adverse effects are additive and generally synergistic. Product is contraindicated for tuberculous or fungal lesions or skin vaccinia, varicella and acute herpes simplex. Topical corticosteroids are contraindicated in those patients with a history of hypersensitivity to any of the components of the preparation."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS: CONCERNS RELATED TO ADVERSE EFFECTS: Methemoglobinemia: Has been reported with local anesthetics; clinically significant methemoglobinemia requires immediate treatment along with discontinuation of the anesthetic and other oxidizing agents. Onset may be immediate or delayed (hours) after anesthetic exposure. Patients with G6PD deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites, or infants <6 months of age are more susceptible and should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (including pale, gray, or blue-colored skin (cyanosis), headache, rapid pulse, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, fatigue). WARNINGS: For external use only. Not for ophthalmic use. Stop use and ask a doctor if condition worsens or symptoms last more than 7 days or clear up and occur again within a few days. Do not apply to wounds or damaged skin. Do not use in large quantities, particularly over raw surfaces or blistered areas. If swallowed, get medical help or contact a Poison Control Center right away. Keep out of reach of children. Topical formulations of lidocaine may be absorbed to a greater extent through mucous membranes and abraded, fissured or irritated skin than through intact skin. Product should not be ingested or applied into the mouth, inside of the nose or in the eyes. Product should not be used in the ears. Any situation where lidocaine penetrates beyond the tympanic membrane into the middle ear is contraindicated because of ototoxicity associated with lidocaine observed in animals when instilled in the middle ear. Product should not come into contact with the eye or be applied into the eye because of the risk of severe eye irritation and the loss of eye surface sensation, which reduces protective reflexes and can lead to corneal irritation and possibly abrasion. If eye contact occurs, rinse out the eye immediately with saline or water and protect the eye surface until sensation is restored."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: If irritation or sensitivity occurs or infection appears, discontinue use and institute appropriate therapy. If extensive areas are treated, the possibility of systemic absorption exists. Systemic absorption of topical steroids has produced reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, manifestation of Cushing\u2019s syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glycosuria in some patients. Conditions which augment systemic absorption include the application of the more potent steroids, use over large surface areas, prolonged use, and the addition of occlusive dressings. Therefore, patients receiving a large dose of potent topical steroids applied to a large surface area, or under an occlusive dressing, should be evaluated periodically for evidence of HPA axis suppression. If noted, an attempt should be made to withdraw the drug, to reduce the frequency of application, or to substitute a less potent steroid. Recovery of the HPA axis function is generally prompt and complete upon discontinuation of the drug. Infrequently, signs and symptoms of steroid withdrawal may occur, requiring supplemental systemic corticosteroids. Children may absorb proportionately larger amounts of topical corticosteroids and thus be more susceptible to systemic toxicity. If irritation develops, topical steroids should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. In the presence of dermatological infections, the use of an appropriate antifungal or antibacterial agent should be instituted. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the corticosteroid should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled."

There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response. General consideration should be given to this fact before administering lidocaine to women of childbearing potential, especially during early pregnancy when maximum organogenesis takes place. Corticosteroids are generally teratogenic in laboratory animals when administered systemically at relatively low dosage levels. The more potent corticosteroids have been shown to be teratogenic after dermal application in laboratory animals. There are no adequate and well controlled studies in pregnant women on teratogenic effects from topically applied corticosteroids. Therefore, topical corticosteroids should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Drugs of this class should not be used extensively on pregnant patients, in large amounts, or for prolonged periods of time."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine besylate tablets are a calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of: Hypertension ( 1.1 ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Coronary Artery Disease ( 1.2 ) Chronic Stable Angina Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40% \u200b1.1 Hypertension Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic An g ina (Prinzmetal's or Variant An g ina ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.",

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reaction to amlodipine is edema which occurred in a dose related manner. Other adverse experiences not dose related but reported with an incidence >1% are fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oxford, at 1-844-508-1455, 8:00 am -4:30 pm ET, Monday \u2013 Friday or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine besylate tablets was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine besylate tablets were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine besylate tablets (N=1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine besylate tablets because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows: Amlodipine Placebo N=520 2.5mg N=275 5 mg N=296 10 mg N=268 Edema 1.8 3.0 10.8 0.6 Dizziness 1.1 3.4 3.4 1.5 Flushing 0.7 1.4 2.6 0.0 Palpitation 0.7 1.4 4.5 0.6 Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following: Amlodipine besylate tablets (%) Placebo (%) N=1730 N=1250 Fatigue 4.5 2.8 Nausea 2.9 1.9 Abdominal pain 1.6 0.3 Somnolence 1.4 0.6 For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table: Amlodipine besylate tablets Placebo Male=% (N=1218) Female=% (N=512) Male=% (N=914) Female=% (N=336) Edema 5.6 14.6 1.4 5.1 Flushing 1.5 4.5 0.3 0.9 Palpitations 1.4 3.3 0.9 0.9 Somnolence 1.3 1.6 0.8 0.3 The following events occurred in <1% but >0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis. Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia. General: allergic reaction, asthenia, 1 back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease. Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps, 1 myalgia. Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male 1 and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization. Respiratory System: dyspnea, 1 epistaxis. Skin and Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus, 1 rash, 1 rash erythematous, rash maculopapular. Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus. Urinary System: micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased. Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst. Hemopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Amlodipine besylate tablets therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. In the CAMELOT and PREVENT studies [ see Clinical Studies (14.4) ], the adverse event profile was similar to that reported previously (see above), with the most common adverse event being peripheral edema. 1 These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.",

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data based on post-marketing reports with amlodipine besylate tablets use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 and 20-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold). Amlodipine has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose [see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Clinical considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Data Animal Data No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (approximately 10 and 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area, respectively) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited available data from a published clinical lactation study reports that amlodipine is present in human milk at an estimated median relative infant dose of 4.2%. No adverse effects of amlodipine on the breastfed infant have been observed. There is no available information on the effects of amlodipine on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use Amlodipine besylate tablets (2.5 to 5 mg daily) are effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Effect of Amlodipine besylate tablets on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine besylate tablets are highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following: Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate tablets reduce the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine besylate tablets have been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro . This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine besylate tablets in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) angina. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine besylate tablets produce vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina. With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine besylate tablets is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine besylate tablets have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine besylate tablets have not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects. Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine besylate tablets do not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine besylate tablets and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine besylate tablets were administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks. Drug interactions Sildenafil: When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine besylate tablets is not altered by the presence of food. Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose. Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Drug interactions In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin. Impact of other dru g s on amlodipine Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine. CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co\u2011administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Impact of amlodipine on other dru g s Amlodipine is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase exposure to CYP3A substrates. Co-administered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time. Simvastatin: Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N=11) showed on an average of 40% increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Tacrolimus: A prospective study in healthy Chinese volunteers (N=9) with CYP3A5 expressers showed a 2.5\u2011to 4-fold increase in tacrolimus exposure when concomitantly administered with amlodipine compared to tacrolimus alone. This finding was not observed in CYP3A5 non-expressers (N= 6). However, a 3-fold increase in plasma exposure to tacrolimus in a renal transplant patient (CYP3A5 non-expresser) upon initiation of amlodipine for the treatment of post-transplant hypertension resulting in reduction of tacrolimus dose has been reported. Irrespective of the CYP3A5 genotype status, the possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 12.4 Pediatric Patients Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine besylate tablets between 1.25 mg and 20 mg.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Effects in Hypertension Adult Patients The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients. Pediatric Patients Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine besylate tablets 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults. 14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine besylate tablets in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine besylate tablets, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 5 mg. Amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm). 14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p<0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine besylate tablets and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement. 14.4 Effects in Documented Coronary Artery Disease In PREVENT, 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease were randomized to amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo and followed for 3 years. Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD. CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main coronary disease and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%. Patients (76% males, 89% Caucasian, 93% enrolled at U.S. sites, 89% with a history of angina, 52% without PCI, 4% with PCI and no stent, and 44% with a stent) were randomized to double-blind treatment with either amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89%), statins (83%), beta-blockers (74%), nitroglycerin (50%), anti-coagulants (40%), and diuretics (32%), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events: hospitalization for angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease. A total of 110 (16.6%) and 151 (23.1%) first events occurred in the amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.540\u20130.884, p = 0.003). The primary endpoint is summarized in Figure 1 below. The outcome of this study was largely derived from the prevention of hospitalizations for angina and the prevention of revascularization procedures (see Table 1 ). Effects in various subgroups are shown in Figure 2 . In an angiographic substudy (n=274) conducted within CAMELOT, there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo on the change of atheroma volume in the coronary artery as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. F igure 1 - Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Composite Clinical Outcomes for Amlodipine versus Placebo Figure 2 \u2013 Effects on Primary Endpoint of Amlodipine Besylate Tablets versus Placebo across Sub- Groups Table 1 below summarizes the significant composite endpoint and clinical outcomes from the composites of the primary endpoint. The other components of the primary endpoint including cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease did not demonstrate a significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo. Table 1.

In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular ejection fraction. In a long-term (follow-up at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo- controlled mortality/morbidity study of amlodipine besylate tablets 5 to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n=931) or IV (n=222) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, amlodipine besylate tablets had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of heart failure. Total combined all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222/571 (39%) for patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 246/583 (42%) for patients on placebo; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25% of the endpoints in the study. Another study (PRAISE-2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%), to placebo (n=827) or amlodipine besylate tablets (n=827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on amlodipine besylate tablets). With amlodipine besylate tablets there were more reports of pulmonary edema."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Nutropin AQ is a recombinant human growth hormone indicated for: Pediatric Patients : Treatment of children with growth failure due to growth hormone deficiency (GHD), idiopathic short stature (ISS), Turner syndrome (TS), and chronic kidney disease (CKD) up to the time of renal transplantation ( 1.1 ). Adult Patients: Treatment of adults with either childhood-onset or adult-onset GHD ( 1.2 ). 1.1 Pediatric Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) - Nutropin AQ \u00ae is indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to inadequate secretion of endogenous growth hormone (GH). Growth Failure Secondary to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of growth failure associated with CKD up to the time of renal transplantation. Nutropin AQ therapy should be used in conjunction with optimal management of CKD. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of ISS, also called non-GHD short stature, defined by height SDS \u2264 \u20132.25, and associated with growth rates unlikely to permit attainment of adult height in the normal range, in pediatric patients whose epiphyses are not closed and for whom diagnostic evaluation excludes other causes associated with short stature that should be observed or treated by other means. Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome (TS) - Nutropin AQ is indicated for the treatment of short stature associated with TS. 1.2 Adult Patients Nutropin AQ is indicated for the replacement of endogenous GH in adults with GHD who meet either of the following two criteria: Adult Onset : Patients who have GHD, either alone or associated with multiple hormone deficiencies (hypopituitarism), as a result of pituitary disease, hypothalamic disease, surgery, radiation therapy, or trauma; or Childhood Onset : Patients who were GH deficient during childhood as a result of congenital, genetic, acquired, or idiopathic causes. Patients who were treated with somatropin for GHD in childhood and whose epiphyses are closed should be reevaluated before continuation of somatropin therapy at the reduced dose level recommended for GH deficient adults. According to current standards, confirmation of the diagnosis of adult GHD in both groups involves an appropriate GH provocative test with two exceptions: (1) patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies due to organic disease; and (2) patients with congenital/genetic GHD."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION For subcutaneous injection . Therapy with Nutropin AQ should be supervised by a physician who is experienced in the diagnosis and management of pediatric patients with short stature associated with growth hormone deficiency (GHD), chronic kidney disease, Turner syndrome, idiopathic short stature, or adult patients with either childhood-onset or adult-onset GHD. Nutropin AQ should be administered subcutaneously ( 2 ). Injection sites should always be rotated to avoid lipoatrophy ( 2.3 ). Pediatric GHD: Up to 0.3 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Pubertal Patients: Up to 0.7 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Idiopathic Short Stature: Up to 0.3 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Chronic Kidney Disease: Up to 0.35 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Turner Syndrome: Up to 0.375 mg/kg/week ( 2.1 ) Adult GHD: Either a non-weight based or weight-based dosing regimen may be followed, with doses adjusted based on treatment response and IGF-I concentrations ( 2.2 ). Non-weight-based: A starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range 0.15\u20130.3 mg/day) increased gradually every 1\u20132 months by increments of approximately 0.1\u20130.2 mg/day. Weight-based : Initiate from not more than 0.006 mg/kg/day; the dose may be increased up to a maximum of 0.025 mg/kg/day in patients \u2264 35 years old or 0.0125 mg/kg/day in patients > 35 years old. 2.1 Dosing for Pediatric Patients Nutropin AQ dosage and administration schedule should be individualized for each patient. Response to growth hormone (GH) therapy in pediatric patients tends to decrease with time. However, in pediatric patients failure to increase growth rate, particularly during the first year of therapy, suggests the need for close assessment of compliance and evaluation of other causes of growth failure, such as hypothyroidism, under-nutrition, advanced bone age and antibodies to recombinant human GH (rhGH). Treatment with Nutropin AQ for short stature should be discontinued when the epiphyses are fused. Pediatric Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD ) A weekly dosage of up to 0.3 mg/kg of body weight divided into daily subcutaneous injection is recommended. In pubertal patients, a weekly dosage of up to 0.7 mg/kg divided daily may be used. Growth Failure Secondary to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) A weekly dosage of up to 0.35 mg/kg of body weight divided into daily subcutaneous injection is recommended. Nutropin AQ therapy may be continued up to the time of renal transplantation. In order to optimize therapy for patients who require dialysis, the following guidelines for injection schedule are recommended: Hemodialysis patients should receive their injection at night just prior to going to sleep or at least 3 to 4 hours after their hemodialysis to prevent hematoma formation due to the heparin. Chronic Cycling Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD) patients should receive their injection in the morning after they have completed dialysis. Chronic Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) patients should receive their injection in the evening at the time of the overnight exchange. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) A weekly dosage of up to 0.3 mg/kg of body weight divided into daily subcutaneous injections is recommended. Short Stature Associated with Turner Syndrome (TS) A weekly dosage of up to 0.375 mg/kg of body weight divided into equal doses 3 to 7 times per week by subcutaneous injection is recommended. 2.2 Dosing for Adult Patients Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Either of two approaches to Nutropin AQ dosing may be followed: a weight-based regimen or a non-weight-based regimen. Weight based \u2013 Based on the dosing regimen used in the original adult GHD registration trials, the recommended dosage at the start of treatment is not more than 0.006 mg/kg daily. The dose may be increased according to individual patient requirements to a maximum of 0.025 mg/kg daily in patients \u2264 35 years and to a maximum of 0.0125 mg/kg daily in patients over 35 years old. Clinical response, side effects, and determination of age- and gender-adjusted serum insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) concentrations should be used as guidance in dose titration. Non-weight based \u2013 Alternatively, taking into account the published literature, a starting dose of approximately 0.2 mg/day (range, 0.15 to 0.30 mg/day) may be used without consideration of body weight. This dose can be increased gradually every 1 to 2 months by increments of approximately 0.1 to 0.2 mg/day, according to individual patient requirements based on the clinical response and serum IGF-1 concentrations. The dose should be decreased as necessary on the basis of adverse events and/or serum IGF-1 concentrations above the age- and gender-specific normal range. Maintenance dosages vary considerably from person to person, and between male and female patients. A lower starting dose and smaller dose increments should be considered for older patients, who are more prone to the adverse effects of somatropin than younger individuals. In addition, obese individuals are more likely to manifest adverse effects, when treated with a weight-based regimen. In order to reach the defined treatment goal, estrogen-replete women may need higher doses than men. Oral estrogen administration may increase the dose requirements in women. 2.3 Preparation and Administration The solution should be clear immediately after removal from the refrigerator. Occasionally, after refrigeration, you may notice that small colorless particles of protein are present in the solution. This is not unusual for solutions containing proteins. Allow the pen cartridge or NuSpin \u00ae to come to room temperature and gently swirl. If the solution is cloudy, the contents MUST NOT be injected. Parenteral drug products should always be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Injection sites, which may be located on the thigh, upper arm, abdomen or buttock, should always be rotated to avoid lipoatrophy. Nutropin AQ Pen Cartridge The Nutropin AQ Pen 10 and 20 mg Cartridges are color-banded to help ensure appropriate use with the Nutropin AQ Pen delivery device. Each cartridge must be used with its corresponding color-coded Nutropin AQ Pen [See Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ] . Wipe the septum of the Nutropin AQ Pen Cartridge with rubbing alcohol or an antiseptic solution to prevent contamination of the contents by microorganisms that may be introduced by repeated needle insertions. It is recommended that Nutropin AQ be administered using sterile, disposable needles. Follow the directions provided in the Nutropin AQ Pen Instructions for Use. The Nutropin AQ Pen 10 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.1 mg to a maximum dose of 4.0 mg, in 0.1 mg increments. The Nutropin AQ Pen 20 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.2 mg to a maximum dose of 8.0 mg, in 0.2 mg increments. Nutropin AQ NuSpin The Nutropin AQ NuSpin 5, 10 and 20 are multi-dose, dial-a-dose injection devices prefilled with Nutropin AQ in a 5 mg/2 mL, 10 mg/2 mL or 20 mg/2 mL cartridge, respectively, for subcutaneous use. It is recommended that Nutropin AQ be administered using sterile, disposable needles. Follow the directions provided in the Nutropin AQ NuSpin 5, 10 or 20 Instructions for Use. The Nutropin AQ NuSpin 5 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.05 mg to a maximum dose of 1.75 mg, in increments of 0.05 mg. The Nutropin AQ NuSpin 10 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.1 mg to a maximum dose of 3.5 mg, in increments of 0.1 mg. The Nutropin AQ NuSpin 20 allows for administration of a minimum dose of 0.2 mg to a maximum dose of 7.0 mg, in increments of 0.2 mg."

      "4 CONTRAINDICATIONS Acute critical illness ( 4 ). Children with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) who are severely obese or have severe respiratory impairment \u2013 reports of sudden death ( 4 ). Active malignancy ( 4 ). Hypersensitivity to somatropin or excipients ( 4 ). Active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( 4 ). Children with closed epiphysis ( 4 ). Acute Critical Illness Treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin is contraindicated in patients with acute critical illness due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ]. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) in Children Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with PWS who are severely obese, have a history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or have severe respiratory impairment. There have been reports of sudden death when somatropin was used in such patients. Nutropin AQ is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed PWS [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Active Malignancy In general, somatropin is contraindicated in the presence of active malignancy. Any pre-existing malignancy should be inactive and its treatment complete prior to instituting therapy with somatropin. Somatropin should be discontinued if there is evidence of recurrent activity. Since growth hormone deficiency (GHD) may be an early sign of the presence of a pituitary tumor (or, rarely, other brain tumors), the presence of such tumors should be ruled out prior to initiation of treatment. Somatropin should not be used in patients with any evidence of progression or recurrence of an underlying intracranial tumor [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ]. Hypersensitivity Nutropin AQ is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to somatropin or any of its excipients. Systemic hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Diabetic Retinopathy Somatropin is contraindicated in patients with active proliferative or severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Closed Epiphysis Somatropin should not be used for growth promotion in pediatric patients with closed epiphysis."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Acute critical illness: Evaluate potential benefit of treatment continuation against potential risk ( 5.1 ). PWS: Evaluate for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiating therapy. Discontinue treatment if these signs occur. ( 5.2 ). Neoplasm: Monitor patients with preexisting tumors for progression or reoccurrence. Increased risk of a second neoplasm in childhood cancer survivors treated with somatropin - in particular meningiomas in patients treated with radiation to the head for their first neoplasm. ( 5.3 ). Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and Diabetes Mellitus (DM): Periodically monitor glucose levels in all patients, as IGT and DM may be unmasked during somatropin therapy. Doses of concurrent antihyperglycemic drugs in patients with DM may require adjustment. ( 5.4 ). Intracranial hypertension (IH): Exclude preexisting papilledema. IH may develop, but is usually reversible after discontinuation or dose reduction ( 5.5 ). Hypersensitivity: Serious hypersensitivity reactions may occur. In the event of an allergic reaction, seek prompt medical attention ( 5.6 ). Fluid retention (e.g., edema, arthralgia, carpal tunnel syndrome- especially in adults): Reduce dose as necessary if such signs develop ( 5.7 ). Hypoadrenalism: Monitor patients for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or need for glucocorticoid dose increase in those with known hypoadrenalism ( 5.8 ). Hypothyroidism: Monitor thyroid function periodically as it may first become evident or worsen after initiation of somatropin ( 5.9 ). Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE): Evaluate any child with onset of a limp or hip/knee pain for possible SCFE and osteonecrosis ( 5.10 ). Progression of preexisting scoliosis: Monitor any child with scoliosis for progression of the curve ( 5.11 ). Pancreatitis: Consider pancreatitis in patients with persistent severe abdominal pain ( 5.16 ). 5.1 Acute Critical Illness Increased mortality in patients with acute critical illnesses due to complications following open heart surgery, abdominal surgery or multiple accidental trauma, or those with acute respiratory failure has been reported after treatment with pharmacologic amounts of somatropin [see Contraindications (4) ] . Two placebo-controlled clinical trials in non-GHD adult patients (n = 522) with these conditions in intensive care units revealed a significant increase in mortality (42% vs. 19%) among somatropin-treated patients (doses 5.3\u20138 mg/day) compared to those receiving placebo. The safety of continuing somatropin treatment in patients receiving replacement doses for approved indications who concurrently develop these illnesses has not been established. Therefore, the potential benefit of treatment continuation with somatropin in patients having acute critical illnesses should be weighed against the potential risk. 5.2 Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) in Children There have been reports of fatalities after initiating therapy with somatropin in pediatric patients with PWS who had one or more of the following risk factors: severe obesity, history of upper airway obstruction or sleep apnea, or unidentified respiratory infection. Male patients with one or more of these factors may be at greater risk than females. Patients with PWS syndrome should be evaluated for signs of upper airway obstruction and sleep apnea before initiation of treatment with somatropin. If during treatment with somatropin, patients show signs of upper airway obstruction (including onset of or increased snoring) and/or new onset sleep apnea, treatment should be interrupted. All patients with PWS treated with somatropin should also have effective weight control and be monitored for signs of respiratory infection, which should be diagnosed as early as possible and treated aggressively [see Contraindications (4) ] . Nutropin AQ is not indicated for the treatment of pediatric patients who have growth failure due to genetically confirmed PWS. 5.3 Neoplasms In childhood cancer survivors who were treated with radiation to the brain/head for their first neoplasm and who developed subsequent GHD and were treated with somatropin, an increased risk of a second neoplasm has been reported. Intracranial tumors, in particular meningiomas, were the most common of these second neoplasms. In adults, it is unknown whether there is any relationship between somatropin replacement therapy and CNS tumor recurrence [see Contraindications (4) ] . Monitor all patients with a history of GHD secondary to an intracranial neoplasm routinely while on somatropin therapy for progression or recurrence of the tumor. Because children with certain rare genetic causes of short stature have an increased risk of developing malignancies, practitioners should thoroughly consider the risks and benefits of starting somatropin in these patients. If treatment with somatropin is initiated, these patients should be carefully monitored for development of neoplasms. Monitor patients on somatropin therapy carefully for increased growth, or potential malignant changes, of preexisting nevi. 5.4 Glucose Intolerance and Diabetes Mellitus Treatment with somatropin may decrease insulin sensitivity, particularly at higher doses in susceptible patients. As a result, previously undiagnosed impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and overt diabetes mellitus may be unmasked during somatropin treatment, and new onset type 2 diabetes mellitus has been reported in patients taking somatropin. Therefore, glucose levels should be monitored periodically in all patients treated with somatropin, especially in those with risk factors for diabetes, such as obesity, Turner syndrome (TS), or a family history of diabetes mellitus. Patients with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus or IGT should be monitored closely during somatropin therapy. The doses of antihyperglycemic drugs (i.e. insulin or oral/injectable agents) may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is instituted in these patients. 5.5 Intracranial Hypertension Intracranial Hypertension (IH) with papilledema, visual changes, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting has been reported in a small number of patients treated with somatropin products. Symptoms usually occurred within the first eight (8) weeks after the initiation of somatropin therapy. In all reported cases, IH-associated signs and symptoms rapidly resolved after cessation of therapy or a reduction of the somatropin dose. Funduscopic examination should be performed routinely before initiating treatment with somatropin to exclude preexisting papilledema, and periodically during the course of somatropin therapy. If papilledema is observed by funduscopy during somatropin treatment, treatment should be stopped. If somatropin-induced IH is diagnosed, treatment with somatropin can be restarted at a lower dose after IH-associated signs and symptoms have resolved. Patients with TS, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and PWS may be at increased risk for the development of IH. 5.6 Severe Hypersensitivity Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reaction and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products. Patients and caregivers should be informed that such reactions are possible and that prompt medical attention should be sought if an allergic reaction occurs. 5.7 Fluid Retention Fluid retention during somatropin replacement therapy in adults may occur. Clinical manifestations of fluid retention (e.g., edema, arthralgia, myalgia, nerve compression syndromes including carpal tunnel syndrome/paraesthesias) are usually transient and dose dependent. 5.8 Hypoadrenalism Patients receiving somatropin therapy who have or are at risk for pituitary hormone deficiency(s) may be at risk for reduced serum cortisol levels and/or unmasking of central (secondary) hypoadrenalism. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment [see Section 7.1, 11-\u03b2 Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 ]. 5.9 Hypothyroidism Undiagnosed/untreated hypothyroidism may prevent an optimal response to somatropin, in particular, the growth response in children. Patients with TS have an inherently increased risk of developing autoimmune thyroid disease and primary hypothyroidism. In patients with GHD, central (secondary) hypothyroidism may first become evident or worsen during somatropin treatment. Therefore, patients treated with somatropin should have periodic thyroid function tests and thyroid hormone replacement therapy should be initiated or appropriately adjusted when indicated. 5.10 Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) in Pediatric Patients SCFE may occur more frequently in patients with endocrine disorders (including GHD and TS) or in patients undergoing rapid growth. SCFE may lead to osteonecrosis. Cases of SCFE with or without osteonecrosis have been reported in pediatric patients with short stature receiving somatropin, including NUTROPIN AQ. Any pediatric patient with the onset of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain during NUTROPIN AQ therapy should be evaluated for SCFE and osteonecrosis and managed accordingly. 5.11 Progression of Preexisting Scoliosis in Pediatric Patients Progression of scoliosis can occur in patients who experience rapid growth. Because somatropin increases growth rate, patients with a history of scoliosis who are treated with somatropin should be monitored for progression of scoliosis. However, somatropin has not been shown to increase the occurrence of scoliosis. Skeletal abnormalities including scoliosis are commonly seen in untreated TS patients. Scoliosis is also commonly seen in untreated patients with PWS. Physicians should be alert to these abnormalities, which may manifest during somatropin therapy. 5.12 Otitis Media and Cardiovascular Disorders in Patients with Turner Syndrome Patients with TS should be evaluated carefully for otitis media and other ear disorders, as these patients have an increased risk of ear and hearing disorders. Somatropin treatment may increase the occurrence of otitis media in patients with TS. In addition, patients with TS should be monitored closely for cardiovascular disorders (e.g., hypertension, aortic aneurysm or dissection, stroke) as these patients are also at increased risk for these conditions. 5.13 Osteodystrophy in Pediatric Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease Children with growth failure secondary to CKD should be examined periodically for evidence of progression of renal osteodystrophy. SCFE or avascular necrosis of the femoral head may be seen in children with advanced renal osteodystrophy, and it is uncertain whether these problems are affected by somatropin therapy. X-rays of the hip should be obtained prior to initiating somatropin therapy in CKD patients and physicians and parents should be alert to the development of a limp or complaints of hip or knee pain in these patients treated with Nutropin AQ. No studies have been completed evaluating Nutropin AQ therapy in patients who have received renal transplants. Currently, treatment of patients with functioning renal allografts is not indicated. 5.14 Lipoatrophy When somatropin is administered subcutaneously at the same site over a long period of time, tissue atrophy may result. This can be avoided by rotating the injection site [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . 5.15 Laboratory Tests Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone (PTH), and IGF-1 may increase during somatropin therapy. 5.16 Pancreatitis Cases of pancreatitis have been reported rarely in children and adults receiving somatropin treatment, with some evidence supporting a greater risk in children compared with adults. Published literature indicates that girls who have TS may be at greater risk than other somatropin-treated children. Pancreatitis should be considered in any somatropin\u2013treated patient, especially a child, who develops persistent severe abdominal pain."

Additional common adverse reactions in adults include edema, arthralgias, and carpal tunnel syndrome ( 6.1 , 6.2 ). To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Genentech at 1-888-835-2555 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed during the clinical trials performed with one somatropin formulation cannot always be directly compared to the rates observed during the clinical trials performed with a second somatropin formulation, and may not reflect the adverse reaction rates observed in practice. Pediatric Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) Injection site discomfort has been reported. This is more commonly observed in children switched from another somatropin product to Nutropin AQ. Turner Syndrome In a randomized, controlled trial, there was a statistically significant increase, as compared to untreated controls, in otitis media (43% vs. 26%) and ear disorders (18% vs. 5%) in patients receiving somatropin. Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) In a post-marketing surveillance study, the National Cooperative Growth Study (NCGS), the pattern of adverse events in over 8,000 patients with ISS was consistent with the known safety profile of growth hormone (GH), and no new safety signals attributable to GH were identified. The frequency of protocol-defined targeted adverse events is described in the table , below. Table 1 Protocol-Defined Targeted Adverse Events in the ISS NCGS Cohort Reported Events NCGS (N = 8018) AVN = avascular necrosis; SCFE = slipped capital femoral epiphysis. Data obtained with several rhGH products (Nutropin, Nutropin AQ, Nutropin Depot and Protropin). Any Adverse Even t Overall 103 (1.3%) Targeted Adverse Event Overall 103 (1.3%) Injection-site reaction 28 (0.3%) New onset or progression of scoliosis 16 (0.2%) Gynecomastia 12 (0.1%) Any new onset or recurring tumor (benign) 12 (0.1%) Arthralgia or arthritis 10 (0.1%) Diabetes mellitus 5 (0.1%) Edema 5 (0.1%) Cancer, neoplasm (new onset or recurrence) 4 (0.0%) Fracture 4 (0.0%) Intracranial hypertension 4 (0.0%) Abnormal bone or other growth 3 (0.0%) Central nervous system tumor 2 (0.0%) New or recurrent SCFE or AVN 2 (0.0%) Carpal tunnel syndrome 1 (0.0%) In subjects treated in a long-term study of Nutropin for ISS, mean fasting and postprandial insulin levels increased, while mean fasting and postprandial glucose levels remained unchanged. Mean hemoglobin A 1c (A1C) levels rose slightly from baseline as expected during adolescence; sporadic values outside normal limits occurred transiently. Adult Patients Growth Hormone Deficiency In clinical studies with Nutropin AQ in GHD adults, edema or peripheral edema was reported in 41% of GH-treated patients and 25% of placebo-treated patients. In GHD adults, arthralgias and other joint disorders were reported in 27% of GH-treated patients and 15% of placebo-treated patients. Nutropin therapy in adults with GHD of adult-onset was associated with an increase of median fasting insulin level in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 9.0 \u00b5U/mL at baseline to 13.0 \u00b5U/mL at Month 12 with a return to the baseline median level after a 3-week post-washout period of GH therapy. In the placebo group there was no change from 8.0 \u00b5U/mL at baseline to Month 12, and after the post-washout period, the median level was 9.0 \u00b5U/mL. The between-treatment group difference on the change from baseline to Month 12 in median fasting insulin level was significant, p < 0.0001. In childhood-onset subjects, there was an increase of median fasting insulin level in the Nutropin 0.025 mg/kg/day group from 11.0 \u00b5U/mL at baseline to 20.0 \u00b5U/mL at Month 12, in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 8.5 \u00b5U/mL to 11.0 \u00b5U/mL, and in the placebo group from 7.0 \u00b5U/mL to 8.0 \u00b5U/mL. The between-treatment group differences for these changes were significant, p = 0.0007. In subjects with adult-onset GHD, there were no between-treatment group differences on change from baseline to Month 12 in mean A1C level, p = 0.08. In childhood-onset GHD, the mean A1C level increased in the Nutropin 0.025 mg/kg/day group from 5.2% at baseline to 5.5% at Month 12, and did not change in the Nutropin 0.0125 mg/kg/day group from 5.1% at baseline or in the placebo group from 5.3% at baseline. The between-treatment group differences were significant, p = 0.009. 6.2 Immunogenicity As with all therapeutic proteins, there is potential for immunogenicity. The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralizing antibody) positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medications, and underlying disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Nutropin with the incidence of antibodies to other products may be misleading. In the case of GH, antibodies with binding capacities lower than 2 mg/L have not been associated with growth attenuation. In a very small number of patients treated with somatropin, when binding capacity was greater than 2 mg/L, interference with the growth response was observed. In clinical studies of pediatric patients that were treated with Nutropin for the first time, 0/107 GHD patients, 0/125 CKD patients, 0/112 TS, and 0/117 ISS patients screened for antibody production developed antibodies with binding capacities \u2265 2 mg/L at six months. In a clinical study of patients that were treated with Nutropin AQ for the first time, 0/38 GHD patients screened for antibody production for up to 15 months developed antibodies with binding capacities \u2265 2 mg/L. Additional short-term immunologic and renal function studies were carried out in a group of pediatric patients with CKD after approximately one year of treatment to detect other potential adverse effects of antibodies to GH. Testing included measurements of C1q, C3, C4, rheumatoid factor, creatinine, creatinine clearance, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). No adverse effects of GH antibodies were noted . 6.3 Post-Marketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of somatropin or NUTROPIN AQ. Because these adverse events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The adverse events reported during post-marketing surveillance do not differ from those listed/discussed above in Sections 6.1 and 6.2 in children and adults. Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and angioedema have been reported with postmarketing use of somatropin products [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ]. Leukemia has been reported in a small number of GHD children treated with somatropin, somatrem (methionylated rhGH) and GH of pituitary origin. It is uncertain whether these cases of leukemia are related to GH therapy, the pathology of GHD itself, or other associated treatments such as radiation therapy. On the basis of current evidence, experts have not been able to conclude that GH therapy per se was responsible for these cases of leukemia. The risk for children with GHD, CKD, or TS, if any, remains to be established [see Contraindications (4) and Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . The following additional adverse reactions have been reported in GH-treated patients: gynecomastia (children), and pancreatitis [Children and adults, see Warnings and Precautions (5.16) ]. The following adverse reactions have been observed during the use of somatropin, including NUTROPIN AQ: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis [children, see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] and osteonecrosis (children)."

      "7 DRUG INTERACTIONS Inhibition of 11 \u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1: May require the initiation of glucocorticoid replacement therapy. Patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance doses ( 7.1 , 7.2 ). Glucocorticoid replacement: Should be carefully adjusted ( 7.2 ). Cytochrome P450- Metabolized Drugs: Monitor carefully if used with somatropin ( 7.3 ). Oral estrogen: Larger doses of somatropin may be required in women ( 7.4 ). Insulin and/or other hypoglycemic agents: May require adjustment ( 7.5 ). 7.1 11 \u03b2-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 1 (11\u03b2HSD-1) The microsomal enzyme 11\u03b2HSD-1 is required for conversion of cortisone to its active metabolite, cortisol, in hepatic and adipose tissue. Growth hormone (GH) and somatropin inhibit 11\u03b2HSD-1. Consequently, individuals with untreated GH deficiency have relative increases in 11\u03b2HSD-1 and serum cortisol. Introduction of somatropin treatment may result in inhibition of 11\u03b2HSD-1 and reduced serum cortisol concentrations. As a consequence, previously undiagnosed central (secondary) hypoadrenalism may be unmasked and glucocorticoid replacement may be required in patients treated with somatropin. In addition, patients treated with glucocorticoid replacement for previously diagnosed hypoadrenalism may require an increase in their maintenance or stress doses following initiation of somatropin treatment; this may be especially true for patients treated with cortisone acetate and prednisone since conversion of these drugs to their biologically active metabolites is dependent on the activity of 11\u03b2HSD-1. 7.2 Pharmacologic Glucocorticoid Therapy and Supraphysiologic Glucocorticoid Treatment Pharmacologic glucocorticoid therapy and supraphysiologic glucocorticoid treatment may attenuate the growth-promoting effects of somatropin in children. Therefore, glucocorticoid replacement therapy should be carefully adjusted in children with concomitant GH and glucocorticoid deficiency to avoid both hypoadrenalism and an inhibitory effect on growth. The use of Nutropin AQ in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) requiring glucocorticoid therapy has not been evaluated. Concomitant glucocorticoid therapy may inhibit the growth promoting effect of Nutropin AQ. Therefore, if glucocorticoid replacement is required for CKD, the glucocorticoid dose should be carefully adjusted to avoid an inhibitory effect on growth. In the clinical trials there was no evidence of drug interactions with Nutropin and commonly used drugs used in the management of CKD. 7.3 Cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-Metabolized Drugs Limited published data indicate that somatropin treatment increases CYP450-mediated antipyrine clearance in man. These data suggest that somatropin administration may alter the clearance of compounds known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes (e.g., corticosteroids, sex steroids, anticonvulsants, cyclosporine). Careful monitoring is advisable when somatropin is administered in combination with other drugs known to be metabolized by CYP450 liver enzymes. However, formal drug interaction studies have not been conducted. 7.4 Oral Estrogen Because oral estrogens may reduce insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) response to somatropin treatment, girls and women receiving oral estrogen replacement may require greater somatropin dosages [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 7.5 Insulin and/or Oral/Injectable Hypoglycemic Agents In patients with diabetes mellitus requiring drug therapy, the dose of insulin and/or oral/injectable hypoglycemic agents may require adjustment when somatropin therapy is initiated [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] ."

It is not known whether Nutropin AQ is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Nutropin AQ is administered to a nursing mother. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of Nutropin AQ did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Elderly patients may be more sensitive to the action of somatropin, and therefore may be more prone to develop adverse reactions.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Nutropin AQ (somatropin) injection, for subcutaneous use is a human growth hormone (hGH) produced by recombinant DNA technology. Nutropin AQ has 191 amino acid residues and a molecular weight of 22,125 daltons. The amino acid sequence of the product is identical to that of pituitary-derived hGH. Nutropin AQ may contain not more than fifteen percent deamidated GH at expiration. The deamidated form of GH has been extensively characterized and has been shown to be safe and fully active. Nutropin AQ is a sterile liquid intended for subcutaneous administration. The product is nearly isotonic at a concentration of 5 mg of GH per mL and has a pH of approximately 6.0. Each pen cartridge or NuSpin contain either 5 mg, 10 mg or 20 mg of somatropin formulated in 17.4 mg sodium chloride, 5 mg phenol, 4 mg polysorbate 20, and 10 mM sodium citrate [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin (as well as endogenous growth hormone) binds to dimeric growth hormone receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) produced in the liver and also locally (e.g., skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (e.g., lipolysis) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical testing have demonstrated that Nutropin AQ is therapeutically equivalent to pituitary-derived hGH. Pediatric patients who lack adequate endogenous growth hormone (GH) secretion, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with Turner syndrome (TS) that were treated with Nutropin AQ or Nutropin resulted in an increase in growth rate and an increase in IGF-1 levels similar to that seen with pituitary-derived hGH. Tissue Growth A) Skeletal Growth : Nutropin AQ stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with growth failure due to a lack of adequate secretion of endogenous GH or secondary to CKD and in patients with TS. Skeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of a growing bone. Growth and metabolism of epiphyseal plate cells are directly stimulated by GH and one of its mediators, IGF-I. Serum levels of IGF-I are low in children and adolescents who are GHD, but increase during treatment with somatropin. In pediatric patients, new bone is formed at the epiphyses in response to GH and IGF-I. This results in linear growth until these growth plates fuse at the end of puberty. B) Cell Growth : Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and the size of skeletal muscle cells. C) Organ Growth : GH influences the size of internal organs, including kidneys, and increases red cell mass. Treatment of hypophysectomized or genetic dwarf rats with somatropin results in organ growth that is proportional to the overall body growth. In normal rats subjected to nephrectomy-induced uremia, somatropin promoted skeletal and body growth. Protein Metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by GH-stimulated protein synthesis. This is reflected by nitrogen retention as demonstrated by a decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during somatropin therapy. Carbohydrate Metabolism GH is a modulator of carbohydrate metabolism. For example, patients with inadequate secretion of GH sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that is improved by treatment with Nutropin AQ. Somatropin therapy may decrease insulin sensitivity. Untreated patients with CKD and TS have an increased incidence of glucose intolerance. Administration of somatropin to adults or children resulted in increases in serum fasting and postprandial insulin levels, more commonly in overweight or obese individuals. In addition, mean fasting and postprandial glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels remained in the normal range. Lipid Metabolism In GHD patients, administration of somatropin resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat stores, increased plasma fatty acids, and decreased plasma cholesterol levels. Mineral Metabolism The retention of total body potassium in response to somatropin administration apparently results from cellular growth. Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus may increase slightly in patients with inadequate secretion of endogenous GH, CKD, or TS during Nutropin AQ therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth as well as increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney. Serum calcium is not significantly altered in these patients. Sodium retention also occurs. Adults with childhood-onset GHD show low bone mineral density (BMD). Nutropin AQ therapy results in increases in serum alkaline phosphatase [see Warnings and Precautions (5.14) ] . Connective Tissue Metabolism GH stimulates the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate and collagen as well as the urinary excretion of hydroxyproline. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Absorption The absolute bioavailability of somatropin after subcutaneous administration in healthy adult males has been determined to be 81 \u00b1 20%. The mean terminal t 1/2 after subcutaneous administration is significantly longer than that seen after intravenous administration (2.1 \u00b1 0.43 hours vs. 19.5 \u00b1 3.1 minutes) indicating that the subcutaneous absorption of the compound is slow and rate-limiting. Distribution Animal studies with somatropin showed that GH localizes to highly perfused organs, particularly the liver and kidney. The volume of distribution at steady state for somatropin in healthy adult males is about 50 mL/kg body weight, approximating the serum volume. Metabolism Both the liver and kidney have been shown to be important metabolizing organs for GH. Animal studies suggest that the kidney is the dominant organ of clearance. GH is filtered at the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubules. It is then cleaved within renal cells into its constituent amino acids, which return to the systemic circulation. Elimination The mean terminal t 1/2 after intravenous administration of somatropin in healthy adult males is estimated to be 19.5 \u00b1 3.1 minutes. Clearance of rhGH after intravenous administration in healthy adults and children is reported to be in the range of 116\u2013174 mL/hr/kg. Bioequivalence of Formulations Nutropin AQ has been determined to be bioequivalent to Nutropin based on the statistical evaluation of area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (C max ). Special Populations Pediatric: Available literature data suggests that somatropin clearances are similar in adults and children. Geriatrics : Limited published data suggest that the plasma clearance and average steady-state plasma concentration of somatropin may not be different between young and elderly patients. Race: Reported values for half-lives for endogenous GH in normal adult black males are not different from observed values for normal adult white males. No data for other races are available. Growth Hormone Deficiency: Reported values for clearance of somatropin in adults and children with GHD range 138\u2013245 mL/hr/kg and are similar to those observed in healthy adults and children. Mean terminal t 1/2 values following intravenous and subcutaneous administration in adult and pediatric GHD patients are also similar to those observed in healthy adult males. Chronic Kidney Disease : Children and adults with CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) tend to have decreased clearance compared to normals. In a study with six pediatric patients 7 to 11 years of age, the clearance of Nutropin was reduced by 21.5% and 22.6% after the intravenous infusion and subcutaneous injection, respectively, of 0.05 mg/kg of Nutropin compared to normal healthy adults. Endogenous GH production may also increase in some individuals with ESRD. However, no somatropin accumulation has been reported in children with CKD or ESRD dosed with current regimens. Turner Syndrome : No pharmacokinetic data are available for exogenously administered somatropin. However, reported half-lives, absorption, and elimination rates for endogenous GH in this population are similar to the ranges observed for normal subjects and GHD populations. Hepatic Insufficiency: A reduction in somatropin clearance has been noted in patients with severe liver dysfunction. The clinical significance of this decrease is unknown. Gender: No gender-specific pharmacokinetic studies have been done with Nutropin AQ. The available literature indicates that the pharmacokinetics of somatropin are similar in men and women.

      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Somatropin (as well as endogenous growth hormone) binds to dimeric growth hormone receptors located within the cell membranes of target tissue cells resulting in intracellular signal transduction and a host of pharmacodynamic effects. Some of these pharmacodynamic effects are primarily mediated by insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) produced in the liver and also locally (e.g., skeletal growth, protein synthesis), while others are primarily a consequence of the direct effects of somatropin (e.g., lipolysis) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In vitro and in vivo preclinical and clinical testing have demonstrated that Nutropin AQ is therapeutically equivalent to pituitary-derived hGH. Pediatric patients who lack adequate endogenous growth hormone (GH) secretion, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and patients with Turner syndrome (TS) that were treated with Nutropin AQ or Nutropin resulted in an increase in growth rate and an increase in IGF-1 levels similar to that seen with pituitary-derived hGH. Tissue Growth A) Skeletal Growth : Nutropin AQ stimulates skeletal growth in pediatric patients with growth failure due to a lack of adequate secretion of endogenous GH or secondary to CKD and in patients with TS. Skeletal growth is accomplished at the epiphyseal plates at the ends of a growing bone. Growth and metabolism of epiphyseal plate cells are directly stimulated by GH and one of its mediators, IGF-I. Serum levels of IGF-I are low in children and adolescents who are GHD, but increase during treatment with somatropin. In pediatric patients, new bone is formed at the epiphyses in response to GH and IGF-I. This results in linear growth until these growth plates fuse at the end of puberty. B) Cell Growth : Treatment with somatropin results in an increase in both the number and the size of skeletal muscle cells. C) Organ Growth : GH influences the size of internal organs, including kidneys, and increases red cell mass. Treatment of hypophysectomized or genetic dwarf rats with somatropin results in organ growth that is proportional to the overall body growth. In normal rats subjected to nephrectomy-induced uremia, somatropin promoted skeletal and body growth. Protein Metabolism Linear growth is facilitated in part by GH-stimulated protein synthesis. This is reflected by nitrogen retention as demonstrated by a decline in urinary nitrogen excretion and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) during somatropin therapy. Carbohydrate Metabolism GH is a modulator of carbohydrate metabolism. For example, patients with inadequate secretion of GH sometimes experience fasting hypoglycemia that is improved by treatment with Nutropin AQ. Somatropin therapy may decrease insulin sensitivity. Untreated patients with CKD and TS have an increased incidence of glucose intolerance. Administration of somatropin to adults or children resulted in increases in serum fasting and postprandial insulin levels, more commonly in overweight or obese individuals. In addition, mean fasting and postprandial glucose and hemoglobin A1C levels remained in the normal range. Lipid Metabolism In GHD patients, administration of somatropin resulted in lipid mobilization, reduction in body fat stores, increased plasma fatty acids, and decreased plasma cholesterol levels. Mineral Metabolism The retention of total body potassium in response to somatropin administration apparently results from cellular growth. Serum levels of inorganic phosphorus may increase slightly in patients with inadequate secretion of endogenous GH, CKD, or TS during Nutropin AQ therapy due to metabolic activity associated with bone growth as well as increased tubular reabsorption of phosphate by the kidney.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Pubertal Patients with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) One open label, multicenter, randomized clinical trial of two dosages of Nutropin was performed in pubertal patients with GHD. Ninety-seven patients (mean age 13.9 years, 83 male, 14 female) currently being treated with approximately 0.3 mg/kg/wk of GH were randomized to 0.3 mg/kg/wk or 0.7 mg/kg/wk Nutropin doses. All patients were already in puberty (Tanner stage \u2265 2) and had bone ages \u2264 14 years in males or \u2264 12 years in females. Mean baseline height standard deviation score (SDS) was \u20131.3. The mean last measured height in all 97 patients after a mean duration of 2.7 \u00b1 1.2 years, by analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) adjusting for baseline height, is shown below. Table 3 Last Measured Height Adjusted for baseline height by Sex and Nutropin Dose for Pubertal Patients with GHD Last Measured Height (cm) Height Difference Between Groups (cm) Age (yr) 0.3 mg/kg/wk 0.7 mg/kg/wk Mean \u00b1 SD (range) Mean \u00b1 SD Mean \u00b1 SD Mean \u00b1 SE Male 17.2 \u00b1 1.3 (13.6 to 19.4) 170.9 \u00b1 7.9 (n = 42) 174.5 \u00b1 7.9 (n = 41) 3.6 \u00b1 1.7 Female 15.8 \u00b1 1.8 (11.9 to 19.3) 154.7 \u00b1 6.3 (n = 7) 157.6 \u00b1 6.3 (n = 7) 2.9 \u00b1 3.4 The mean height SDS at last measured height (n = 97) was \u20130.7 \u00b1 1.0 in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group and \u2013 0.1 \u00b1 1.2 in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group. For patients completing 3.5 or more years (mean 4.1 years) of Nutropin treatment (15/49 patients in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group and 16/48 patients in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group), the mean last measured height was 166.1 \u00b1 8.0 cm in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group and 171.8 \u00b1 7.1 cm in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group, adjusting for baseline height and sex. The mean change in bone age was approximately one year for each year in the study in both dose groups. Patients with baseline height SDS above \u20131.0 were able to attain normal adult heights with the 0.3 mg/kg/wk dose of Nutropin (mean height SDS at near-adult height = \u20130.1, n = 15). Thirty-one patients had bone mineral density (BMD) determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans at study conclusion. The two dose groups did not differ significantly in mean SDS for total body BMD (\u20130.9 \u00b1 1.9 in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group vs. \u20130.8 \u00b1 1.2 in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group, n = 20) or lumbar spine BMD (\u20131.0 \u00b1 1.0 in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group vs. \u20130.2 \u00b1 1.7 in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group, n = 21). Over a mean duration of 2.7 years, patients in the 0.7 mg/kg/wk group were more likely to have IGF-I values above the normal range than patients in the 0.3 mg/kg/wk group (27.7% vs. 9.0% of IGF-I measurements for individual patients). The clinical significance of elevated IGF-I values is unknown. 14.2 Pediatric Patients with Growth Failure Secondary to Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Two multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trials were conducted to determine whether treatment with Nutropin prior to renal transplantation in patients with CKD could improve their growth rates and height deficits. One study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial and the other was an open-label, randomized trial. The dose of Nutropin in both controlled studies was 0.05 mg/kg/day (0.35 mg/kg/week) administered daily by subcutaneous injection. Combining the data from those patients completing two years in the two controlled studies results in 62 patients treated with Nutropin and 28 patients in the control groups (either placebo-treated or untreated). The mean first year growth rate was 10.8 cm/yr for Nutropin-treated patients, compared with a mean growth rate of 6.5 cm/yr for placebo/untreated controls (p < 0.00005). The mean second year growth rate was 7.8 cm/yr for the Nutropin-treated group, compared with 5.5 cm/yr for controls (p < 0.00005). There was a significant increase in mean height SDS in the Nutropin group (\u20132.9 at baseline to \u20131.5 at Month 24, n = 62) but no significant change in the controls (-2.8 at baseline to \u20132.9 at Month 24, n = 28). The mean third year growth rate of 7.6 cm/yr in the Nutropin-treated patients (n = 27) suggests that Nutropin stimulates growth beyond two years. However, there are no control data for the third year because control patients crossed over to Nutropin treatment after two years of participation. The gains in height were accompanied by appropriate advancement of skeletal age. These data demonstrate that Nutropin therapy improves growth rate and corrects the acquired height deficit associated with CKD. The North American Pediatric Renal Transplant Cooperative Study (NAPRTCS) has reported data for growth post-transplant in children who did not receive GH prior to transplantation as well as children who did receive Nutropin during the clinical trials prior to transplantation. The average change in height SDS during the initial two years post-transplant was 0.15 for the 2,391 patients who did not receive GH pre-transplant and 0.28 for the 57 patients who did 1 . For patients who were followed for 5 years post-transplant , the corresponding changes in height SDS were also similar between groups . 14.3 Pediatric Patients with Turner Syndrome (TS) Three US studies, two long-term, open-label, multicenter, historically controlled studies (Studies 1 and 2), and one long-term, randomized, dose-response study (Study 3) and one Canadian, long-term, randomized, open-label, multicenter, concurrently controlled study, were conducted to evaluate the efficacy of somatropin treatment of short stature due to TS. In the US Studies 1 and 2, the effect of long-term GH treatment (0.375 mg/kg/week given either 3 times per week or daily) on adult height was determined by comparing adult heights in the treated patients with those of age-matched historical controls with TS who received no growth-promoting therapy. In Study 1, estrogen treatment was delayed until patients were at least age 14. GH therapy resulted in a mean adult height gain of 7.4 cm (mean duration of GH therapy of 7.6 years) vs. matched historical controls by ANCOVA. In Study 2, patients treated with early Nutropin therapy (before 11 years of age) were randomized to receive estrogen-replacement therapy (conjugated estrogens, 0.3 mg escalating to 0.625 mg daily) at either age 12 or 15 years. Compared with matched historical controls, early Nutropin therapy (mean duration of 5.6 years) combined with estrogen replacement at age 12 years resulted in an adult height gain of 5.9 cm (n = 26), whereas girls who initiated estrogen at age 15 years (mean duration of Nutropin therapy 6.1 years) had a mean adult height gain of 8.3 cm (n = 29). Patients who initiated Nutropin after age 11 (mean age 12.7 years; mean duration of Nutropin therapy 3.8 years) had a mean adult height gain of 5.0 cm (n = 51). Thus, in Studies 1 and 2, the greatest improvement in adult height was observed in patients who received early GH treatment and estrogen after age 14 years. In Study 3, a randomized, blinded dose-response study, patients were treated from a mean age of 11.1 years for a mean duration of 5.3 years with a weekly GH dose of either 0.27 mg/kg or 0.36 mg/kg administered in divided doses 3 or 6 times weekly. The mean near-final height of GH-treated patients was 148.7 \u00b1 6.5 cm (n = 31). When compared to historical control data, the mean gain in adult height was approximately 5 cm. The Canadian randomized study compared near-adult height outcomes for GH-treated patients to those of a concurrent control group who received no injections. The somatropin-treated patients received a dosage of 0.3 mg/kg/week given in divided doses 6 times per week from a mean age of 11.7 years for a mean duration of 4.7 years. Puberty was induced with a standardized estrogen regimen initiated at 13 years of age for both treatment groups. The somatropin-treated group (n = 27) attained a mean (\u00b1 SD) near final height of 146.0 \u00b1 6.2 cm; the untreated control group (n = 19) attained a near final height of 142.1 \u00b1 4.8 cm. By ANCOVA (with adjustments for baseline height and mid-parental height), the effect of GH-treatment was a mean height increase of 5.4 cm (p = 0.001). In summary, patients with TS (total n = 181 from the 4 studies above) treated to adult height achieved statistically significant average height gains ranging from 5.0\u20138.3 cm.

Canadian RCT 27 11.7 13 4.7 5.4 14.4 Pediatric Patient with Idiopathic Short Stature (ISS) A long-term, open-label, multicenter study was conducted to examine the safety and efficacy of Nutropin in pediatric patients with ISS, also called non-growth hormone deficient short stature. For the first year, 122 pre-pubertal subjects over the age of 5 years with stimulated serum GH \u2265 10 ng/mL were randomized into two treatment groups of approximately equal size; one group was treated with Nutropin 0.3 mg/kg weekly divided into three doses per week and the other group served as untreated controls. For the second and subsequent years of the study, all subjects were re-randomized to receive the same total weekly dose of Nutropin (0.3 mg/kg weekly) administered either daily or three times weekly. Treatment with Nutropin was continued until a subject's bone age was > 15.0 years (boys) or > 14.0 years (girls) and the growth rate was < 2 cm/yr, after which subjects were followed until adult height was achieved. The mean baseline values were: height SDS\u20132.8, IGF-I SDS -0.9, age 9.4 years, bone age 7.8 years, growth rate 4.4 cm/yr, mid-parental target height SDS \u20130.7, and Bayley-Pinneau predicted adult height SDS \u20132.3. Nearly all subjects had predicted adult height that was less than mid-parental target height. During the one-year controlled phase of the study, the mean height velocity increased by 0.5 \u00b1 1.8 cm (mean \u00b1 SD) in the no-treatment control group and by 3.1 \u00b1 1.7 cm in the Nutropin group (p < 0.0001). For the same period of treatment the mean height SDS increased by 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 and remained unchanged (0.0 \u00b1 0.2) in the control group (p < 0.001). Of the 118 subjects who were treated with Nutropin (70%) reached near-adult height (hereafter called adult height) after 2\u201310 years of Nutropin therapy. Their last measured height, including post-treatment follow-up, was obtained at a mean age of 18.3 years in males and 17.3 years in females. The mean duration of therapy was 6.2 and 5.5 years, respectively. Adult height was greater than pretreatment predicted adult height in 49 of 60 males (82%) and 19 of 23 females (83%). The mean difference between adult height and pretreatment predicted adult height was 5.2 cm (2.0 inches) in males and 6.0 cm (2.4 inches) in females (p < 0.0001 for both). The table (below) summarizes the efficacy data.

During continued treatment, mean IGF-I levels remained close to the normal mean. IGF-I SDS above + 2 occurred sporadically in 14 subjects. 14.5 Adult Growth Hormone Deficiency Two multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials were conducted in growth hormone-deficient adults. Study 1 was conducted in subjects with adult-onset GHD (n = 166), mean age 48.3 years, at doses of 0.0125 or 0.00625 mg/kg/day; doses of 0.025 mg/kg/day were not tolerated in these subjects. Study 2 was conducted in previously treated subjects with childhood-onset GHD (n = 64), mean age 23.8 years, at randomly assigned doses of 0.025 or 0.0125 mg/kg/day. The studies were designed to assess the effects of replacement therapy with Nutropin on body composition. Significant changes from baseline to Month 12 of treatment in body composition (i.e., total body % fat mass, trunk % fat mass, and total body % lean mass by DEXA scan) were seen in all Nutropin groups in both studies (p < 0.0001 for change from baseline and vs. placebo), whereas no statistically significant changes were seen in either of the placebo groups. In the adult-onset study, the Nutropin group improved mean total body fat from 35.0% to 31.5%, mean trunk fat from 33.9% to 29.5%, and mean lean body mass from 62.2% to 65.7%, whereas the placebo group had mean changes of 0.2% or less (p = not significant). Due to the possible effect of GH-induced fluid retention on DEXA measurements of lean body mass, DEXA scans were repeated approximately 3 weeks after completion of therapy; mean % lean body mass in the Nutropin group was 65.0%, a change of 2.8% from baseline, compared with a change of 0.4% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001 between groups). In the childhood-onset study, the high-dose Nutropin group improved mean total body fat from 38.4% to 32.1%, mean trunk fat from 36.7% to 29.0%, and mean lean body mass from 59.1% to 65.5%; the low-dose Nutropin group improved mean total body fat from 37.1% to 31.3%, mean trunk fat from 37.9% to 30.6%, and mean lean body mass from 60.0% to 66.0%; the placebo group had mean changes of 0.6% or less (p = not significant).

In the childhood-onset study significant decreases from baseline to Month 12 in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and LDL:HDL ratio were seen in the high-dose Nutropin group only, compared to the placebo group, p < 0.05. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in HDL cholesterol or triglycerides from baseline to Month 12. In the childhood-onset study, 55% of the patients had decreased spine BMD (z-score < \u20131) at baseline. The administration of Nutropin (n = 16) (0.025 mg/kg/day) for two years resulted in increased spine BMD from baseline when compared to placebo (n = 13) (4.6% vs. 1.0%, respectively, p < 0.03); a transient decrease in spine BMD was seen at six months in the Nutropin-treated patients. Thirty-five percent of subjects treated with this dose had supraphysiological levels of IGF-I at some point during the study, which may carry unknown risks. No significant improvement in total body BMD was found when compared to placebo. A lower GH dose (0.0125 mg/kg/day) did not show significant increments in either of these bone parameters when compared to placebo. No statistically significant effects on BMD were seen in the adult-onset study where patients received GH (0.0125 mg/kg/day) for one year. Muscle strength, physical endurance, and quality of life measurements were not markedly abnormal at baseline, and no statistically significant effects of Nutropin therapy were observed in the two studies. A subsequent 32-week, multicenter, open-label, controlled clinical trial was conducted using Nutropin AQ, Nutropin Depot, or no treatment in adults with both adult-onset and childhood-onset GHD. Subjects were randomized into the three groups to evaluate effects on body composition, including change in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as determined by computed tomography (CT) scan. For subjects evaluable for change in VAT in the Nutropin AQ (n = 44) and untreated (n = 19) groups, the mean age was 46.2 years and 78% had adult-onset GHD. Subjects in the Nutropin AQ group were treated at doses up to 0.012 mg/kg per day in women (all of whom received estrogen replacement therapy) and men under age 35 years, and up to 0.006 mg/kg per day in men over age 35 years. The mean absolute change in VAT from baseline to Week 32 was \u201310.7 cm 2 in the Nutropin AQ group and + 8.4 cm 2 in the untreated group (p = 0.013 between groups). There was a 6.7% VAT loss in the Nutropin AQ group (mean percent change from baseline to Week 32) compared with a 7.5% increase in the untreated group (p = 0.012 between groups). The effect of reducing VAT in adult GHD patients with Nutropin AQ on long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is not known, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

      "Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch 5% performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours. Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value <0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Risk of Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue lidocaine patch 5% and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen. Accidental Exposure in Children Even a used lidocaine patch 5% contains a large amount of lidocaine (at least 665 mg). The potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used lidocaine patch 5%, although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated. It is important for patients to store and dispose of lidocaine patch 5% out of the reach of children, pets, and others (see HANDLING AND DISPOSAL). Excessive Dosing Excessive dosing by applying lidocaine patch 5% to larger areas or for longer than the recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood concentrations, leading to serious adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions). Lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 mcg/mL. The blood concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination. Longer duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller patients, or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of lidocaine. With recommended dosing of lidocaine patch 5%, the average peak blood concentration is about 0.13 mcg/mL, but concentrations higher than 0.25 mcg/mL have been observed in some individuals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hepatic Disease Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally. Allergic Reactions Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. However, lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain. Non-intact Skin Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption. Lidocaine patch 5% is only recommended for use on intact skin. External Heat Sources Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over lidocaine patch 5% is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma lidocaine levels. Eye Exposure The contact of lidocaine patch 5% with eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns. Information for Patients Methemoglobinemia Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue. Drug Interactions Antiarrhythmic Drugs Lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Local Anesthetics When lidocaine patch 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered. Drugs That May Cause Methemoglobinemia When Used with Lidocaine Patch 5% Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics: Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitric oxide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, tetracaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid, sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants Phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, quinine, sulfasalazine Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Mutagenesis Lidocaine HCl is not mutagenic in Salmonella/mammalian microsome test nor clastogenic in chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes and mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effect of lidocaine patch 5% on fertility has not been studied. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in pregnancy. Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, lidocaine patch 5% should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in labor and delivery. Lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should lidocaine patch 5% be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered. Nursing Mothers Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in nursing mothers. Lidocaine is excreted in human milk, and the milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4. Caution should be exercised when lidocaine patch 5% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

These reactions are generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within a few minutes to hours. Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm, pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Other Adverse Events Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including: Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence, taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and tremor. Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine patch 5% are unlikely, due to the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold, or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest."

If there is any suspicion of lidocaine overdose (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions), drug blood concentration should be checked. The management of overdose includes close monitoring, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdose with lidocaine. In the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion, evaluation of symptoms of toxicity should include consideration of other etiologies for the clinical effects, or overdosage from other sources of lidocaine or other local anesthetics.

      "DESCRIPTION Lidocaine Patch 5% is comprised of an adhesive material containing 5% lidocaine, which is applied to a non-woven polyester felt backing and covered with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film release liner. The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm x 14 cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: purified water, glycerin, sorbitol, polyacrylic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium polyacrylate, propylene glycol, urea, kaolin, tartaric acid, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, edetate disodium, methylparaben, and propylparaben. molecule"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When Lidocaine Patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine Patch 5% performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours. Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value <0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Risk of Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue Lidocaine Patch 5% and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen. Accidental Exposure in Children Even a used lidocaine patch 5% contains a large amount of lidocaine (at least 665 mg). The potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used lidocaine patch 5%, although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated. It is important for patients to store and dispose of Lidocaine Patch 5% out of the reach of children, pets, and others (see HANDLING AND DISPOSAL). Excessive Dosing Excessive dosing by applying Lidocaine Patch 5% to larger areas or for longer than the recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood concentrations, leading to serious adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions). Lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 mcg/mL. The blood concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination. Longer duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller patients, or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of lidocaine. With recommended dosing of lidocaine patch 5%, the average peak blood concentration is about 0.13 mcg/mL, but concentrations higher than 0.25 mcg/mL have been observed in some individuals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hepatic Disease Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally. Allergic Reactions Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. However, Lidocaine Patch 5% should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain. Non-intact Skin Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption. Lidocaine Patch 5% is only recommended for use on intact skin. External Heat Sources Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over lidocaine patch 5% is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma lidocaine levels. Eye Exposure The contact of Lidocaine Patch 5% with eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns. Information for Patients Methemoglobinemia Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue. Drug Interactions Antiarrhythmic Drugs - Lidocaine Patch 5% should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Local Anesthetics - When Lidocaine Patch 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered. Drugs That May Cause Methemoglobinemia When Used with Lidocaine Patch 5% Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics: Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitric oxide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, tetracaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid, sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants Phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, quinine, sulfasalazine Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of Lidocaine Patch 5% . Mutagenesis Lidocaine HCl is not mutagenic in Salmonella/mammalian microsome test nor clastogenic in chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes and mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effect of lidocaine on fertility has not been studied. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Lidocaine Patch 5% has not been studied in pregnancy. Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Lidocaine Patch 5% should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Lidocaine Patch 5% has not been studied in labor and delivery. Lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should Lidocaine Patch 5% be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered. Nursing Mothers Lidocaine Patch 5% has not been studied in nursing mothers. Lidocaine is excreted in human milk, and the milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4. Caution should be exercised when Lidocaine Patch 5% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Application Site Reactions During or immediately after treatment with Lidocaine Patch 5% , the skin at the site of application may develop blisters, bruising, burning sensation, depigmentation, dermatitis, discoloration, edema, erythema, exfoliation, irritation, papules, petechia, pruritus, vesicles, or may be the locus of abnormal sensation. These reactions are generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within a few minutes to hours. Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm, pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Other Adverse Events Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including: Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence, taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and tremor. Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of Lidocaine Patch 5% are unlikely, due to the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold, or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest."

If there is any suspicion of lidocaine overdose (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions), drug blood concentration should be checked. The management of overdose includes close monitoring, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdose with lidocaine. In the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion, evaluation of symptoms of toxicity should include consideration of other etiologies for the clinical effects, or overdosage from other sources of lidocaine or other local anesthetics. The oral LD 50 of lidocaine HCl is 459 (346 to 773) mg/kg (as the salt) in non-fasted female rats and 214 (159 to 324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats, which are equivalent to roughly 4000 mg and 2000 mg, respectively, in a 60 to 70 kg man based on the equivalent surface area dosage conversion factors between species."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Mechanism of Action: Lidotral\u00ae 5% Roll on Gel releases lidocaine from a mild acidic vehicle to stabilize the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. A mild acidic vehicle lowers pH to increase protection against alkaline irritants and to provide a favorable environment for healing. Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/ toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics, but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."

      "DESCRIPTION Lidocaine patch 5% is comprised of an adhesive material containing 5% lidocaine, which is applied to a non-woven polyester felt backing and covered with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film release liner. The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm x 14 cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: purified water, glycerin, sorbitol, polyacrylic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium polyacrylate, propylene glycol, urea, kaolin, tartaric acid, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, edetate disodium, methylparaben, and propylparaben. molecule"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch 5% performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours. Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value <0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups."

    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Risk of Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue lidocaine patch 5% and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen. Accidental Exposure in Children Even a used lidocaine patch 5% contains a large amount of lidocaine (at least 665 mg). The potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used lidocaine patch 5%, although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated. It is important for patients to store and dispose of lidocaine patch 5% out of the reach of children, pets, and others (see HANDLING AND DISPOSAL). Excessive Dosing Excessive dosing by applying lidocaine patch 5% to larger areas or for longer than the recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood concentrations, leading to serious adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions). Lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 mcg/mL. The blood concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination. Longer duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller patients, or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of lidocaine. With recommended dosing of lidocaine patch 5%, the average peak blood concentration is about 0.13 mcg/mL, but concentrations higher than 0.25 mcg/mL have been observed in some individuals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hepatic Disease Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally. Allergic Reactions Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. However, lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain. Non-intact Skin Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption. Lidocaine patch 5% is only recommended for use on intact skin. External Heat Sources Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over lidocaine patch 5% is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma lidocaine levels. Eye Exposure The contact of lidocaine patch 5% with eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns. Information for Patients Methemoglobinemia Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue. Drug Interactions Antiarrhythmic Drugs Lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Local Anesthetics When lidocaine patch 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered. Drugs That May Cause Methemoglobinemia When Used with Lidocaine Patch 5% Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics: Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitric oxide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, tetracaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid, sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants Phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, quinine, sulfasalazine Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Mutagenesis Lidocaine HCl is not mutagenic in Salmonella/mammalian microsome test nor clastogenic in chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes and mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effect of lidocaine patch 5% on fertility has not been studied. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in pregnancy. Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, lidocaine patch 5% should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in labor and delivery. Lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should lidocaine patch 5% be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered. Nursing Mothers Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in nursing mothers. Lidocaine is excreted in human milk, and the milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4. Caution should be exercised when lidocaine patch 5% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Application Site Reactions During or immediately after treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, the skin at the site of application may develop blisters, bruising, burning sensation, depigmentation, dermatitis, discoloration, edema, erythema, exfoliation, irritation, papules, petechia, pruritus, vesicles, or may be the locus of abnormal sensation. These reactions are generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within a few minutes to hours. Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm, pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Other Adverse Events Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including: Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence, taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and tremor. Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine patch 5% are unlikely, due to the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold, or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Lidocaine overdose from cutaneous absorption is rare, but could occur. If there is any suspicion of lidocaine overdose (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions), drug blood concentration should be checked. The management of overdose includes close monitoring, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdose with lidocaine. In the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion, evaluation of symptoms of toxicity should include consideration of other etiologies for the clinical effects, or overdosage from other sources of lidocaine or other local anesthetics. The oral LD 50 of lidocaine HCl is 459 (346 to 773) mg/kg (as the salt) in non-fasted female rats and 214 (159 to 324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats, which are equivalent to roughly 4000 mg and 2000 mg, respectively, in a 60 to 70 kg man based on the equivalent surface area dosage conversion factors between species."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Mechanism of Action: Lidotral\u00ae 5% Gel releases lidocaine from a mild acidic vehicle to stabilize the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. A mild acidic vehicle lowers pH to increase protection against alkaline irritants and to provide a favorable environment for healing. Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/ toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics, but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."

      "DESCRIPTION Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection in the Cryovac plastic container for intravenous use is composed of clindamycin phosphate equivalent to 300, 600 and 900 mg of clindamycin premixed with 5% dextrose as a sterile solution. Disodium edetate has been added at a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL. The pH has been adjusted with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid. Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin. The chemical name of clindamycin phosphate is L- threo-\u03b1 -D- galacto - Octopyranoside, methyl-7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-[[(1-methyl-4-propyl-2- pyrrolidinyl) carbonyl] amino]-1-thio-, 2-(dihydrogen phosphate), (2 S-trans )-. The molecular formula is C 18 H 34 CIN 2 0 8 PS and the molecular weight is 504.97. The structural formula is represented below: The plastic container is fabricated from a specially designed multilayer plastic, M312A material. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to the USP biological tests for plastic containers, as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies. structure-formula"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Distribution Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is converted to active clindamycin. By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin. Excretion Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. Specific Populations Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4 hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function 1 . Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with PMA \u226432 weeks, or >32 to \u226440 weeks Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in body weight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA). The dosing regimens for pediatric patients \u226432 weeks PMA (5 mg/kg) and >32 to \u226440 weeks PMA (7 mg/kg), both administered intravenously every 8 hours, achieve exposures comparable to therapeutic exposures in adults (weighing 70 kg) administered clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours ( Table 1 ).

Obese Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to Less than 18 Years and Obese Adults Aged 18 to 20 Years An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and obese adults aged 18 to 20 years demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution, normalized by total body weight, are comparable regardless of obesity. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ): Gram-positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Anaerobic Bacteria Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium necrophorum Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Prevotella melaninogenica The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for clindamycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of clindamycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the BOXED WARNING , before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin). Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below: Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae , other streptococci (except E. faecalis ), and Staphylococcus aureus . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus , and anaerobes. Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes. Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms. Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus , streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis ), and susceptible anaerobes. Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNING . Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . In case of such an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue treatment permanently and institute appropriate therapy. A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens. Nephrotoxicity Clindamycin is potentially nephrotoxic and cases with acute kidney injury have been reported. Consider monitoring of renal function particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or those taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In case of acute kidney injury, discontinue clindamycin when no other etiology is identified. Usage in Meningitis Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency. Clindamycin should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Clindamycin should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals. Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy. The use of clindamycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms- particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. Clindamycin should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10 to 60 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. Clindamycin dosage modification is not necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease. Prescribing clindamycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed. Drug Interactions Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness. In vitro studies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities. Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Nursing Mothers Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use When clindamycin sterile solution is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Usage in Newborns and Infants The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficile ) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (>60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration."
    ],
    "general_precautions": [
      "General Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency. Clindamycin should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Clindamycin should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals. Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy. The use of clindamycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms- particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. Clindamycin should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10 to 60 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. Clindamycin dosage modification is not necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease. Prescribing clindamycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION If diarrhea occurs during therapy, this antibiotic should be discontinued (see WARNING box). Adults Parenteral (IV Administration) Serious infections due to aerobic gram-positive cocci and the more susceptible anaerobes (NOT generally including Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus species and Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens ): 600 to 1,200 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. More severe infections, particularly those due to proven or suspected Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus species, or Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens : 1,200 to 2,700 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. For more serious infections, these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations due to either aerobes or anaerobes these doses may be increased. Doses of as much as 4,800 mg daily have been given intravenously to adults. See IV Infusion Rates section below. Alternatively, drug may be administered in the form of a single rapid infusion of the first dose followed by continuous IV infusion as follows: Table 2. Serum Clindamycin Levels Maintained, Rapid Infusion Rate and Maintenance Infusion Rate To Maintain Serum Clindamycin Levels Rapid Infusion Rate Maintenance Infusion Rate Above 4 mcg/mL 10 mg/min for 30 min 0.75 mg/min Above 5 mcg/mL 15 mg/min for 30 min 1 mg/min Above 6 mcg/mL 20 mg/min for 30 min 1.25 mg/min Pediatric patients 1 month of age to 16 years Parenteral (IV) Administration 20 to 40 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equal doses. The higher doses would be used for more severe infections. Clindamycin should be dosed based on total body weight regardless of obesity. As an alternative to dosing on a body weight basis, pediatric patients may be dosed on the basis of square meters body surface: 350 mg/m 2 /day for serious infections and 450 mg/m 2 /day for more severe infections. Parenteral therapy may be changed to oral clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride flavored granules or clindamycin hydrochloride capsules when the condition warrants and at the discretion of the physician. In cases of \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal infections, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Pediatric Patients less than 1 month The recommended dosage is 15 to 20 mg/kg/day in 3 to 4 equal doses. See Table 3 regarding the dosing regimen for pediatric patients with post-menstrual age (PMA) less than or equal to 32 weeks, or greater than 32 weeks to less than or equal to 40 weeks. Table 3. Dosing Regimens for Pediatric Patients with PMA less than or equal to 32 weeks, or greater than 32 weeks to less than or equal to 40 weeks PMA (weeks) Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) Less than or equal to 32 5 8 Greater than or equal to 32 to less than or equal to 40 7 8 PMA: Post-Menstrual age IV Infusion Rates Infusion rates for Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection should not exceed 30 mg per minute.

DIRECTIONS FOR USE Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection in Cryovac Plastic Container Premixed Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. Check for minute leaks prior to use by squeezing bag firmly. If leaks are found, discard solution as sterility may be impaired. Do not add supplementary medication. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration whenever solution and container permit. Do not use unless solution is clear and seal is intact. Caution Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is complete. Preparation for Administration 1. Suspend container from eyelet support. 2. Remove protector from outlet port at bottom of container. 3. Attach administration set. Refer to complete directions accompanying set."

      "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: Reduce resistance to new infections Exacerbate existing infections Increase the risk of disseminated infections Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If PredniSONE Tablets USP is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are nonimmune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles: If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with PredniSONE Tablets USP. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid PredniSONE Tablets USP use in the presence of such infections unless PredniSONE Tablets USP is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating PredniSONE Tablets USP in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, in patients with cerebral malaria. Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Information for Patients Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT \u00ae (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing\u2019s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known, and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment (see Tables 3-4). 2.4 Premedication It is recommended that patients receive premedication with antiemetic agents. In clinical studies of the weekly dosage schedule, the majority of patients received 10 mg of dexamethasone given in conjunction with another type of antiemetic agent, such as a 5-HT 3 blocker (e.g., ondansetron or granisetron). Antiemetic agents should be given on the day of treatment, starting at least 30 minutes before administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Physicians should also consider providing patients with an antiemetic regimen (e.g., prochlorperazine) for subsequent use as needed. Prophylactic or therapeutic administration of atropine should be considered in patients experiencing cholinergic symptoms. 2.5 Preparation of Infusion Solution Inspect vial contents for particulate matter and discoloration and repeat inspection when drug product is withdrawn from vial into syringe. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection 20 mg/mL is intended for single use only and any unused portion should be discarded. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection must be diluted prior to infusion. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection should be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, (preferred) or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a final concentration range of 0.12 mg/mL to 2.8 mg/mL. Other drugs should not be added to the infusion solution. The solution is physically and chemically stable for up to 24 hours at room temperature and in ambient fluorescent lighting. Solutions diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and stored at refrigerated temperatures (approximately 2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F), and protected from light are physically and chemically stable for 48 hours. Refrigeration of admixtures using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, is not recommended due to a low and sporadic incidence of visible particulates. Freezing irinotecan hydrochloride injection and admixtures of irinotecan hydrochloride injection may result in precipitation of the drug and should be avoided. The irinotecan hydrochloride injection solution should be used immediately after reconstitution as it contains no antibacterial preservative. Because of possible microbial contamination during dilution, it is advisable to use the admixture prepared with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, within 24 hours if refrigerated (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). In the case of admixtures prepared with 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, or Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, the solutions should be used within 4 hours if kept at room temperature. If reconstitution and dilution are performed under strict aseptic conditions (e.g., on Laminar Air Flow bench), irinotecan hydrochloride injection solution should be used (infusion completed) within 12 hours at room temperature or 24 hours if refrigerated (2\u00b0 to 8\u00b0C, 36\u00b0 to 46\u00b0F). 2.6 Safe Handling Care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of infusion solutions prepared from irinotecan hydrochloride injection. The use of gloves is recommended. If a solution of irinotecan hydrochloride injection contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and thoroughly with soap and water. If irinotecan hydrochloride injection contacts the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Several published guidelines for handling and disposal of anticancer agents are available. 2.7 Extravasation Care should be taken to avoid extravasation, and the infusion site should be monitored for signs of inflammation. Should extravasation occur, flushing the site with sterile water and applications of ice are recommended."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Diarrhea and cholinergic reactions: Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan hydrochloride injection) is usually transient and may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection) can occur. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Treat with loperamide. Use antibiotic support for ileus and fever. Interrupt irinotecan hydrochloride injection and reduce subsequent doses if severe diarrhea occurs.( 5.1 ) Myelosuppression: Manage promptly with antibiotic support. Interrupt irinotecan hydrochloride injection and reduce subsequent doses if necessary. ( 5.2 ) Patients with Reduced UGT1A1 Activity: Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride injection treatment. ( 5.3 ) Hypersensitivity: Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue irinotecan hydrochloride injection if this occurs. ( 5.4 ) Renal Impairment/Renal Failure: Rare cases of renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. ( 5.5 ) Pulmonary Toxicity: Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred. Interrupt for new or progressive dysnpnea, cough, and fever pending evaluation. If IPD diagnosed, discontinue and institute appropriate treatment as needed. ( 5.6 ) Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen: Irinotecan hydrochloride injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4-5 consecutive days every 4 weeks outside of a clinical study. ( 5.7 ) Embryofetal Toxicity: Irinotecan hydrochloride injection can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. ( 5.9 ) Patients with Hepatic Impairment: In clinical trials, irinotecan hydrochloride injection has not been administered to patients with serum bilirubin > 2.0 mg/dL, or transaminases > 3 times ULN if no liver metastases, or transaminases > 5 times ULN if liver metastases. With the weekly dosage schedule, patients with total bilirubin levels 1.0-2.0 mg/dL had greater likelihood of grade 3-4 neutropenia. ( 5.10 ) 5.1 Diarrhea and Cholinergic Reactions Early diarrhea (occurring during or shortly after infusion of Irinotecan hydrochloride) is usually transient and infrequently severe. It may be accompanied by cholinergic symptoms of rhinitis, increased salivation, miosis, lacrimation, diaphoresis, flushing, and intestinal hyperperistalsis that can cause abdominal cramping. Bradycardia may also occur. Early diarrhea and other cholinergic symptoms may be prevented or treated. Consider prophylactic or therapeutic administration of 0.25 mg to 1 mg of intravenous or subcutaneous atropine (unless clinically contraindicated). These symptoms are expected to occur more frequently with higher irinotecan doses. Late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride) can be life threatening since it may be prolonged and may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, or sepsis. Grade 3-4 late diarrhea occurred in 23-31% of patients receiving weekly dosing. In the clinical studies, the median time to the onset of late diarrhea was 5 days with 3-week dosing and 11 days with weekly dosing. Late diarrhea can be complicated by colitis, ulceration, bleeding, ileus, obstruction, and infection. Cases of megacolon and intestinal perforation have been reported. Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea. Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Monitor and replace fluid and electrolytes. Use antibiotic support for ileus, fever, or severe neutropenia. Subsequent weekly chemotherapy treatments should be delayed in patients until return of pretreatment bowel function for at least 24 hours without anti-diarrhea medication. Patients must not be treated with Irinotecan hydrochloride until resolution of the bowel obstruction. If grade 2, 3, or 4 late diarrhea recurs, subsequent doses of Irinotecan hydrochloride should be decreased [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Avoid diuretics or laxatives in patients with diarrhea. 5.2 Myelosuppression Deaths due to sepsis following severe neutropenia have been reported in patients treated with Irinotecan hydrochloride. In the clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, neutropenic fever (concurrent NCI grade 4 neutropenia and fever of grade 2 or greater) occurred in 3% of the patients; 6% of patients received G-CSF for the treatment of neutropenia. Manage febrile neutropenia promptly with antibiotic support [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Hold Irinotecan hydrochloride if neutropenic fever occurs or if the absolute neutrophil count drops <1000/mm 3 . After recovery to an absolute neutrophil count \u22651000/mm 3 , subsequent doses of irinotecan hydrochloride should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . When evaluated in the trials of weekly administration, the frequency of grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was higher in patients who received previous pelvic/abdominal irradiation than in those who had not received such irradiation (48% [13/27] versus 24% [67/277]; p=0.04). Patients who have previously received pelvic/abdominal irradiation are at increased risk of severe myelosuppression following the administration of Irinotecan hydrochloride. Based on sparse available data, the concurrent administration of Irinotecan hydrochloride with irradiation is not recommended. Patients with baseline serum total bilirubin levels of 1.0 mg/dL or more also had a greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/266]; p<0.001). Patients with deficient glucuronidation of bilirubin, such as those with Gilbert's syndrome, may be at greater risk of myelosuppression when receiving therapy with Irinotecan hydrochloride. 5.3 Patients With Reduced UGT1A1 Activity Individuals who are homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele (UGT1A1 7/7 genotype) are at increased risk for neutropenia following initiation of Irinotecan hydrochloride treatment. In a study of 66 patients who received single-agent Irinotecan hydrochloride (350 mg/m 2 once-every-3-weeks), the incidence of grade 4 neutropenia in patients homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele was 50%, and in patients heterozygous for this allele (UGT1A1 6/7 genotype) the incidence was 12.5%. No grade 4 neutropenia was observed in patients homozygous for the wild-type allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype). When administered as a single-agent, a reduction in the starting dose by at least one level of Irinotecan hydrochloride should be considered for patients known to be homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele. However, the precise dose reduction in this patient population is not known and subsequent dose modifications should be considered based on individual patient tolerance to treatment [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . UGT1A1 Testing A laboratory test is available to determine the UGT1A1 status of patients. Testing can detect the UGT1A1 6/6, 6/7 and 7/7 genotypes. 5.4 Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions including severe anaphylactic or anaphylactoid reactions have been observed. Discontinue Irinotecan hydrochloride if anaphylactic reaction occurs. 5.5 Renal Impairment/Renal Failure Renal impairment and acute renal failure have been identified, usually in patients who became volume depleted from severe vomiting and/or diarrhea. 5.6 Pulmonary Toxicity Interstitial Pulmonary Disease (IPD)-like events, including fatalities, have occurred in patients receiving irinotecan (in combination and as monotherapy). Risk factors include pre-existing lung disease, use of pneumotoxic drugs, radiation therapy, and colony stimulating factors. Patients with risk factors should be closely monitored for respiratory symptoms before and during Irinotecan hydrochloride therapy. In Japanese studies, a reticulonodular pattern on chest x-ray was observed in a small percentage of patients. New or progressive, dyspnea, cough, and fever should prompt interruption of chemotherapy, pending diagnostic evaluation. If IPD is diagnosed, Irinotecan hydrochloride and other chemotherapy should be discontinued and appropriate treatment instituted as needed [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . 5.7 Toxicity of the 5 Day Regimen Outside of a well-designed clinical study, irinotecan hydrochloride injection should not be used in combination with a regimen of 5-FU/LV administered for 4-5 consecutive days every 4 weeks because of reports of increased toxicity, including toxic deaths. Irinotecan hydrochloride should be used as recommended in Table 2 [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . 5.8 Increased Toxicity in Patients with Performance Status 2 In the clinical trials, higher rates of hospitalization, neutropenic fever, thromboembolism, first-cycle treatment discontinuation, and early deaths were observed in patients with a baseline performance status of 2 than in patients with a baseline performance status of 0 or 1. 5.9 Embryofetal Toxicity Irinotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Irinotecan was embryotoxic in rats and rabbits at doses significantly lower than those administered to humans on a mg/m 2 basis. In rats, at exposures approximately 0.2 times those achieved in humans at the 125 mg/m 2 dose, irinotecan was embryotoxic and resulted in decreased learning ability and female fetal body weight in surviving pups; the drug was teratogenic at lower exposures (approximately 0.025 times the AUC in humans at the 125 mg/m 2 dose).There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with Irinotecan hydrochloride. 5.10 Patients with Hepatic Impairment The use of Irinotecan hydrochloride in patients with significant hepatic impairment has not been established. In clinical trials of either dosing schedule, irinotecan was not administered to patients with serum bilirubin >2.0 mg/dL, or transaminase >3 times the upper limit of normal if no liver metastasis, or transaminase >5 times the upper limit of normal with liver metastasis. In clinical trials of the weekly dosage schedule, patients with modestly elevated baseline serum total bilirubin levels (1.0 to 2.0 mg/dL) had a significantly greater likelihood of experiencing first-cycle, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia than those with bilirubin levels that were less than 1.0 mg/dL (50% [19/38] versus 18% [47/226]; p<0.001) [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.7) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Common adverse reactions ( > 30%) observed in single agent therapy clinical studies are: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, neutropenia, leukopenia (including lymphocytopenia), anemia, asthenia, fever, body weight decreasing, alopecia. ( 6.1 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact 1-888-557-1212 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Studies Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. Common adverse reactions ( > 30%) observed in single agent therapy clinical studies are: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, anorexia, neutropenia, leukopenia (including lymphocytopenia), anemia, asthenia, fever, body weight decreasing, and alopecia. Serious opportunistic infections have not been observed, and no complications have specifically been attributed to lymphocytopenia. Second-Line Single-Agent Therapy Weekly Dosage Schedule In three clinical studies evaluating the weekly dosage schedule, 304 patients with metastatic carcinoma of the colon or rectum that had recurred or progressed following 5-FU-based therapy were treated with Irinotecan hydrochloride. Seventeen of the patients died within 30 days of the administration of Irinotecan hydrochloride; in five cases (1.6%, 5/304), the deaths were potentially drug-related. One of the patients died of neutropenic sepsis without fever. Neutropenic fever occurred in nine (3.0%) other patients; these patients recovered with supportive care. One hundred nineteen (39.1%) of the 304 patients were hospitalized because of adverse events; 81 (26.6%) patients were hospitalized for events judged to be related to administration of Irinotecan hydrochloride. The primary reasons for drug-related hospitalization were diarrhea, with or without nausea and/or vomiting (18.4%); neutropenia/leukopenia, with or without diarrhea and/or fever (8.2%); and nausea and/or vomiting (4.9%). The first dose of at least one cycle of Irinotecan hydrochloride was reduced for 67% of patients who began the studies at the 125-mg/m 2 starting dose. Within-cycle dose reductions were required for 32% of the cycles initiated at the 125-mg/m 2 dose level. The most common reasons for dose reduction were late diarrhea, neutropenia, and leukopenia. Thirteen (4.3%) patients discontinued treatment with Irinotecan hydrochloride because of adverse events. The adverse events in Table 7 are based on the experience of the 304 patients enrolled in the three studies described in Clinical Studies (14.1) . Table 7.

Eleven (3.5%) patients treated with irinotecan died within 30 days of treatment. In three cases (1%, 3/316), the deaths were potentially related to irinotecan treatment and were attributed to neutropenic infection, grade 4 diarrhea, and asthenia, respectively. One (0.8%, 1/129) patient treated with 5-FU died within 30 days of treatment; this death was attributed to grade 4 diarrhea. Hospitalizations due to serious adverse events occurred at least once in 60% (188/316) of patients who received irinotecan, 63% (57/90) who received best supportive care, and 39% (50/129) who received 5-FU-based therapy. Eight percent of patients treated with irinotecan and 7% treated with 5-FU-based therapy discontinued treatment due to adverse events. Of the 316 patients treated with irinotecan, the most clinically significant adverse events (all grades, 1-4) were diarrhea (84%), alopecia (72%), nausea (70%), vomiting (62%), cholinergic symptoms (47%), and neutropenia (30%). Table 8 lists the grade 3 and 4 adverse events reported in the patients enrolled to all treatment arms of the two studies described in Clinical Studies (14.1 ) .

The 8.5% incidence of akathisia, however, is within the range reported for use of prochlorperazine when given as a premedication for other chemotherapies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post approval use of Irinotecan hydrochloride. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Myocardial ischemic events have been observed following Irinotecan hydrochloride therapy. Thromboembolic events have been observed in patients receiving Irinotecan hydrochloride. Symptomatic pancreatitis, asymptomatic pancreatic enzyme elevation have been reported. Increases in serum levels of transaminases (i.e., AST and ALT) in the absence of progressive liver metastasis have been observed. Hyponatremia, mostly with diarrhea and vomiting, has been reported. Transient dysarthria has been reported in patients treated with Irinotecan hydrochloride; in some cases, the event was attributed to the cholinergic syndrome observed during or shortly after infusion of irinotecan. Interaction between Irinotecan hydrochloride and neuromuscular blocking agents cannot be ruled out. Irinotecan has anticholinesterase activity, which may prolong the neuromuscular blocking effects of suxamethonium and the neuromuscular blockade of non-depolarizing drugs may be antagonized."

( 7.2 ) Strong CYP3A4 Inhibitors: Do not administer strong CYP3A4 inhibitors with Irinotecan hydrochloride. ( 7.3 ) 7.2 Strong CYP3A4 Inducers Exposure to irinotecan or its active metabolite SN-38 is substantially reduced in adult and pediatric patients concomitantly receiving the CYP3A4 enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or St. John's wort. The appropriate starting dose for patients taking these or other strong inducers such as rifampin and rifabutin has not been defined. Consider substituting non-enzyme inducing therapies at least 2 weeks prior to initiation of irinotecan hydrochloride injection therapy. Do not administer strong CYP3A4 inducers with irinotecan hydrochloride injection unless there are no therapeutic alternatives. 7.3 Strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 Inhibitors Irinotecan and its active metabolite, SN-38, are metabolized via the human cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4) and uridine diphosphate-glucuronosyl transferase 1A1 (UGT1A1), respectively, [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Patients receiving concomitant ketoconazole, a CYP3A4 and UGT1A1 inhibitor, have increased exposure to irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38. Coadministration of irinotecan hydrochloride with other inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, lopinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telaprevir, voriconazole) or UGT1A1 (e.g., atazanavir, gemfibrozil, indinavir) may increase systemic exposure to irinotecan or SN-38. Discontinue strong CYP3A4 inhibitors at least 1 week prior to starting irinotecan hydrochloride injection therapy. Do not administer strong CYP3A4 or UGT1A1 inhibitors with irinotecan hydrochloride injection unless there are no therapeutic alternatives."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Nursing Mothers: Discontinue nursing when receiving therapy with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. ( 8.3 ) Geriatric Use: Closely monitor patients greater than 65 years of age because of a greater risk of early and late diarrhea in this population. ( 8.5 ) Patients with Renal Impairment : Use caution and do not use in patients on dialysis. ( 8.6 ) Patients with Hepatic Impairment : Use caution. ( 2 , 5.10 , 8.7 , 12.3 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Irinotecan hydrochloride can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Radioactivity related to 14 C-irinotecan crosses the placenta of rats following intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg (which in separate studies produced an irinotecan C max and AUC about 3 and 0.5 times, respectively, the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg/m 2 ). Intravenous administration of irinotecan 6 mg/kg/day to rats and rabbits during the period of organogenesis resulted in increased post-implantation loss and decreased numbers of live fetuses. In separate studies in rats, this dose produced an Irinotecan C max and AUC of about 2 and 0.2 times, respectively, the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg/m 2 . In rabbits, the embryotoxic dose was about one-half the recommended human weekly starting dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Irinotecan was teratogenic in rats at doses greater than 1.2 mg/kg/day and in rabbits at 6.0 mg/kg/day. In separate studies in rats, this dose produced an irinotecan C max and AUC about 2/3 and 1/40th, respectively, of the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg/m 2 . In rabbits, the teratogenic dose was about one-half the recommended human weekly starting dose on a mg/m 2 basis. Teratogenic effects included a variety of external, visceral, and skeletal abnormalities. Irinotecan administered to rat dams for the period following organogenesis through weaning at doses of 6 mg/kg/day caused decreased learning ability and decreased female body weights in the offspring. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of irinotecan in pregnant women. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving treatment with irinotecan hydrochloride injection. 8.3 Nursing Mothers Radioactivity appeared in rat milk within 5 minutes of intravenous administration of radiolabeled irinotecan and was concentrated up to 65-fold at 4 hours after administration relative to plasma concentrations. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from irinotecan hydrochloride, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. 8.4 Pediatric Use The effectiveness of irinotecan in pediatric patients has not been established. Results from two open-label, single arm studies were evaluated. One hundred and seventy children with refractory solid tumors were enrolled in one phase 2 trial in which 50 mg/ m 2 of irinotecan was infused for 5 consecutive days every 3 weeks. Grade 3-4 neutropenia was experienced by 54 (31.8%) patients.Neutropenia was complicated by fever in 15 (8.8%) patients. Grade 3-4 diarrhea was observed in 35 (20.6%) patients. This adverse event profile was comparable to that observed in adults. In the second phase 2 trial of 21 children with previously untreated rhabdomyosarcoma, 20 mg/m 2 of irinotecan was infused for 5 consecutive days on weeks 0, 1, 3 and 4. This single agent therapy was followed by multimodal therapy. Accrual to the single agent irinotecan phase was halted due to the high rate (28.6%) of progressive disease and the early deaths (14%). The adverse event profile was different in this study from that observed in adults; the most significant grade 3 or 4 adverse events were dehydration experienced by 6 patients (28.6%) associated with severe hypokalemia in 5 patients (23.8%) and hyponatremia in 3 patients (14.3%); in addition Grade 3-4 infection was reported in 5 patients (23.8%) (across all courses of therapy and irrespective of causal relationship). Pharmacokinetic parameters for irinotecan and SN-38 were determined in 2 pediatric solid-tumor trials at dose levels of 50 mg/m 2 (60-min infusion, n=48) and 125 mg/m 2 (90-min infusion, n=6). Irinotecan clearance (mean + S.D.) was 17.3 + 6.7 L/h/m 2 for the 50mg/m 2 dose and 16.2 + 4.6 L/h/m 2 for the 125 mg/m 2 dose, which is comparable to that in adults. Dose-normalized SN-38 AUC values were comparable between adults and children. Minimal accumulation of irinotecan and SN-38 was observed in children on daily dosing regimens [daily x 5 every 3 weeks or (daily x 5) x 2 weeks every 3 weeks]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Patients greater than 65 years of age should be closely monitored because of a greater risk of early and late diarrhea in this population [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . The starting dose of irinotecan hydrochloride in patients 70 years and older for the once-every-3-week-dosage schedule should be 300 mg/m 2 [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) and Dosage and Administration (2) ] . The frequency of grade 3 and 4 late diarrhea by age was significantly greater in patients \u226565 years than in patients <65 years (40% [53/133] versus 23% [40/171]; p=0.002). In another study of 183 patients treated on the weekly schedule, the frequency of grade 3 or 4 late diarrhea in patients > 65 years of age was 28.6% [26/91] and in patients <65 years of age was 23.9% [22/92]. 8.6 Renal Impairment The influence of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated. Therefore, use caution in patients with impaired renal function. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection is not recommended for use in patients on dialysis. 8.7 Hepatic Impairment Irinotecan clearance is diminished in patients with hepatic impairment while exposure to the active metabolite SN-38 is increased relative to that in patients with normal hepatic function. The magnitude of these effects is proportional to the degree of liver impairment as measured by elevations in total bilirubin and transaminase concentrations. Therefore, use caution when administering irinotecan hydrochloride patients with hepatic impairment. The tolerability of irinotecan in patients with hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dl) has not been assessed sufficiently, and no recommendations for dosing can be made [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] ."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I, which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Irinotecan serves as a water-soluble precursor of the lipophilic metabolite SN-38. SN-38 is formed from irinotecan by carboxylesterase-mediated cleavage of the carbamate bond between the camptothecin moiety and the dipiperidino side chain. SN-38 is approximately 1000 times as potent as irinotecan as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I purified from human and rodent tumor cell lines. In vitro cytotoxicity assays show that the potency of SN-38 relative to irinotecan varies from 2- to 2000-fold; however, the plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) values for SN-38 are 2% to 8% of irinotecan and SN-38 is 95% bound to plasma proteins compared to approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins for irinotecan [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan hydrochloride is thus unknown. Both irinotecan and SN-38 exist in an active lactone form and an inactive hydroxy acid anion form. A pH-dependent equilibrium exists between the two forms such that an acid pH promotes the formation of the lactone, while a more basic pH favors the hydroxy acid anion form. Administration of irinotecan has resulted in antitumor activity in mice bearing cancers of rodent origin and in human carcinoma xenografts of various histological types. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After intravenous infusion of irinotecan in humans, irinotecan plasma concentrations decline in a multiexponential manner, with a mean terminal elimination half-life of about 6 to 12 hours. The mean terminal elimination half-life of the active metabolite SN-38 is about 10 to 20 hours. The half-lives of the lactone (active) forms of irinotecan and SN-38 are similar to those of total irinotecan and SN-38, as the lactone and hydroxy acid forms are in equilibrium. Over the recommended dose range of 50 to 350 mg/m 2 , the AUC of irinotecan increases linearly with dose; the AUC of SN-38 increases less than proportionally with dose. Maximum concentrations of the active metabolite SN-38 are generally seen within 1 hour following the end of a 90-minute infusion of irinotecan. Pharmacokinetic parameters for Irinotecan and SN-38 following a 90-minute infusion of irinotecan at dose levels of 125 and 340 mg/m 2 determined in two clinical studies in patients with solid tumors are summarized in Table 9: Table 9: Summary of Mean (\u00b1Standard Deviation) Irinotecan and SN-38 Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Patients with Solid Tumors C max - Maximum plasma concentration AUC 0-24 - Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours after the end of the 90-minute infusion t 1/2 - Terminal elimination half-life Vz - Volume of distribution of terminal elimination phase CL - Total systemic clearance a Plasma specimens collected for 24 hours following the end of the 90-minute infusion. b Plasma specimens collected for 48 hours following the end of the 90-minute infusion.

SN-38 is highly bound to human plasma proteins (approximately 95% bound). The plasma protein to which irinotecan and SN-38 predominantly binds is albumin. Metabolism Irinotecan is subject to extensive metabolic conversion by various enzyme systems, including esterases to form the active metabolite SN-38, and UGT1A1 mediating glucuronidation of SN-38 to form the inactive glucuronide metabolite SN-38G. Irinotecan can also undergo CYP3A4- mediated oxidative metabolism to several inactive oxidation products, one of which can be hydrolyzed by carboxylesterase to release SN-38. In vitro studies indicate that irinotecan, SN-38 and another metabolite aminopentane carboxylic acid (APC), do not inhibit cytochrome P-450 isozymes. UGT1A1 activity is reduced in individuals with genetic polymorphisms that lead to reduced enzyme activity such as the UGT1A1 * 28 polymorphism. Approximately 10% of the North American population is homozygous for the UGT1A1 * 28 allele (also referred to as UGT1A1 7/7 genotype). In a prospective study, in which irinotecan was administered as a single-agent (350 mg/m 2 ) on a once-every-3-week schedule, patients with the UGT1A1 7/7 genotype had a higher exposure to SN-38 than patients with the wild-type UGT1A1 allele (UGT1A1 6/6 genotype) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) and Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . SN-38 glucuronide had 1/50 to 1/100 the activity of SN-38 in cytotoxicity assays using two cell lines in vitro . Excretion The disposition of irinotecan has not been fully elucidated in humans. The urinary excretion of irinotecan is 11% to 20%; SN-38, <1%; and SN-38 glucuronide, 3%. The cumulative biliary and urinary excretion of irinotecan and its metabolites (SN-38 and SN-38 glucuronide) over a period of 48 hours following administration of irinotecan in two patients ranged from approximately 25% (100 mg/m 2 ) to 50% (300 mg/m 2 ). Effect of Age The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan administered using the weekly schedule was evaluated in a study of 183 patients that was prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age on irinotecan toxicity. Results from this trial indicate that there are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan, SN-38, and SN-38 glucuronide in patients <65 years of age compared with patients \u2265 65 years of age. In a study of 162 patients that was not prospectively designed to investigate the effect of age, small (less than 18%) but statistically significant differences in dose-normalized irinotecan pharmacokinetic parameters in patients <65 years of age compared to patients \u226565 years of age were observed. Although dose-normalized AUC 0-24 for SN-38 in patients \u2265 65 years of age was 11% higher than in patients <65 years of age, this difference was not statistically significant. No change in the starting dose is recommended for geriatric patients receiving the weekly dosage schedule of irinotecan [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Effect of Gender The pharmacokinetics of irinotecan do not appear to be influenced by gender. Effect of Race The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated. Effect of Hepatic Impairment Irinotecan clearance is diminished in patients with hepatic impairment while exposure to the active metabolite SN-38 is increased relative to that in patients with normal hepatic function. The magnitude of these effects is proportional to the degree of liver impairment as measured by elevations in total bilirubin and transaminase concentrations. However, the tolerability of irinotecan in patients with hepatic dysfunction (bilirubin greater than 2 mg/dl) has not been assessed sufficiently, and no recommendations for dosing can be made [see Dosage and Administration (2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.10) and Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Effect of Renal Impairment The influence of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan has not been evaluated. Therefore, caution should be undertaken in patients with impaired renal function. Irinotecan hydrochloride is not recommended for use in patients on dialysis [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Drug Interactions Dexamethasone, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer, does not appear to alter the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Irinotecan is a derivative of camptothecin. Camptothecins interact specifically with the enzyme topoisomerase I, which relieves torsional strain in DNA by inducing reversible single-strand breaks. Irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38 bind to the topoisomerase I-DNA complex and prevent religation of these single-strand breaks. Current research suggests that the cytotoxicity of irinotecan is due to double-strand DNA damage produced during DNA synthesis when replication enzymes interact with the ternary complex formed by topoisomerase I, DNA, and either irinotecan or SN-38. Mammalian cells cannot efficiently repair these double-strand breaks."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Irinotecan serves as a water-soluble precursor of the lipophilic metabolite SN-38. SN-38 is formed from irinotecan by carboxylesterase-mediated cleavage of the carbamate bond between the camptothecin moiety and the dipiperidino side chain. SN-38 is approximately 1000 times as potent as irinotecan as an inhibitor of topoisomerase I purified from human and rodent tumor cell lines. In vitro cytotoxicity assays show that the potency of SN-38 relative to irinotecan varies from 2- to 2000-fold; however, the plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC) values for SN-38 are 2% to 8% of irinotecan and SN-38 is 95% bound to plasma proteins compared to approximately 50% bound to plasma proteins for irinotecan [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The precise contribution of SN-38 to the activity of irinotecan hydrochloride is thus unknown. Both irinotecan and SN-38 exist in an active lactone form and an inactive hydroxy acid anion form. A pH-dependent equilibrium exists between the two forms such that an acid pH promotes the formation of the lactone, while a more basic pH favors the hydroxy acid anion form. Administration of irinotecan has resulted in antitumor activity in mice bearing cancers of rodent origin and in human carcinoma xenografts of various histological types."

Rats were, however, administered intravenous doses of 2 mg/kg or 25 mg/kg irinotecan once per week for 13 weeks (in separate studies, the 25 mg/kg dose produced an irinotecan C max and AUC that were about 7.0 times and 1.3 times the respective values in patients administered 125 mg/m 2 weekly) and were then allowed to recover for 91 weeks. Under these conditions, there was a significant linear trend with dose for the incidence of combined uterine horn endometrial stromal polyps and endometrial stromal sarcomas. Irinotecan was clastogenic both in vitro (chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster ovary cells) and in vivo (micronucleus test in mice). Neither irinotecan nor its active metabolite SN-38 was mutagenic in the in vitro Ames assay. No significant adverse effects on fertility and general reproductive performance were observed after intravenous administration of irinotecan in doses of up to 6 mg/kg/day to rats and rabbits; however, atrophy of male reproductive organs was observed after multiple daily irinotecan doses both in rodents at 20 mg/kg and in dogs at 0.4 mg/kg. In separate studies in rodents, this dose produced an irinotecan C max and AUC about 5 and 1 times, respectively, of the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg/m 2 weekly. In dogs this dose produced an irinotecan C max and AUC about one-half and 1/15 th , respectively, of the corresponding values in patients administered 125 mg/m 2 weekly."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES Irinotecan has been studied in clinical trials as a single agent [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] . Weekly and once-every-3-week dosage schedules were used for the single-agent irinotecan studies. Clinical studies single-agent use are described below. 14.1 Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Second-Line Therapy After 5-FU-Based Treatment 4 Weekly Doses on a 6-Week Cycle: Studies 3, 4, and 5 Data from three open-label, single-agent, clinical studies, involving a total of 304 patients in 59 centers, support the use of irinotecan hydrochloride in the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum that has recurred or progressed following treatment with 5-FU-based therapy. These studies were designed to evaluate tumor response rate and do not provide information on effects on survival and disease-related symptoms. In each study, irinotecan hydrochloride was administered in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of a 90-minute intravenous infusion once weekly for 4 weeks, followed by a 2-week rest period. Starting doses of irinotecan hydrochloride in these trials were 100, 125, or 150 mg/m 2 , but the 150-mg/m 2 dose was poorly tolerated (due to high rates of grade 4 late diarrhea and febrile neutropenia). Study 3 enrolled 48 patients and was conducted by a single investigator at several regional hospitals. Study 4 was a multicenter study conducted by the North Central Cancer Treatment Group. All 90 patients enrolled in Study 4 received a starting dose of 125 mg/m 2 . Study 5 was a multicenter study that enrolled 166 patients from 30 institutions. The initial dose in Study 5 was 125 mg/m 2 but was reduced to 100 mg/m 2 because the toxicity seen at the 125-mg/m 2 dose was perceived to be greater than that seen in previous studies. All patients in these studies had metastatic colorectal cancer, and the majority had disease that recurred or progressed following a 5-FU-based regimen administered for metastatic disease. The results of the individual studies are shown in Table 11. Table 11.

Among these 193 patients, 2 complete and 27 partial responses were observed, for an overall response rate of 15.0% (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 10.0% to 20.1%) at this starting dose. A considerably lower response rate was seen with a starting dose of 100 mg/m 2 . The majority of responses were observed within the first two cycles of therapy, but responses did occur in later cycles of treatment (one response was observed after the eighth cycle). The median response duration for patients beginning therapy at 125 mg/m 2 was 5.8 months (range, 2.6 to 15.1 months). Of the 304 patients treated in the three studies, response rates to irinotecan hydrochloride were similar in males and females and among patients older and younger than 65 years. Rates were also similar in patients with cancer of the colon or cancer of the rectum and in patients with single and multiple metastatic sites. The response rate was 18.5% in patients with a performance status of 0 and 8.2% in patients with a performance status of 1 or 2. Patients with a performance status of 3 or 4 have not been studied. Over half of the patients responding to irinotecan hydrochloride had not responded to prior 5-FU. Patients who had received previous irradiation to the pelvis responded to irinotecan hydrochloride at approximately the same rate as those who had not previously received irradiation. Once-Every-3-Week Dosage Schedule Single Arm Study: Study 6 Data from an open-label, single-agent, single-arm, multicenter, clinical study involving a total of 132 patients support a once every-3-week dosage schedule of irinotecan in the treatment of patients with metastatic cancer of the colon or rectum that recurred or progressed following treatment with 5-FU. Patients received a starting dose of 350 mg/m 2 given by 30-minute intravenous infusion once every 3 weeks. Among the 132 previously treated patients in this trial, the intent-to-treat response rate was 12.1% (95% CI, 7.0% to 18.1%). Randomized Studies: Studies 7 and 8 Two multicenter, randomized, clinical studies further support the use of irinotecan given by the once-every-3-week dosage schedule in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose disease has recurred or progressed following prior 5-FU therapy. In Study 7, second-line irinotecan therapy plus best supportive care was compared with best supportive care alone. In Study 8, second-line irinotecan therapy was compared with infusional 5-FU-based therapy. In both studies, irinotecan was administered intravenously at a starting dose of 350 mg/m 2 over 90 minutes once every 3 weeks. The starting dose was 300 mg/m 2 for patients who were 70 years and older or who had a performance status of 2. The highest total dose permitted was 700 mg. Dose reductions and/or administration delays were permitted in the event of severe hematologic and/or nonhematologic toxicities while on treatment. Best supportive care was provided to patients in both arms of Study 7 and included antibiotics, analgesics, corticosteroids, transfusions, psychotherapy, or any other symptomatic therapy as clinically indicated. In both studies, concomitant medications such as antiemetics, atropine, and loperamide were given to patients for prophylaxis and/or management of symptoms from treatment. If late diarrhea persisted for greater than 24 hours despite loperamide, a 7-day course of fluoroquinolone antibiotic prophylaxis was given. Patients in the control arm of the Study 8 received one of the following 5-FU regimens: (1) LV, 200 mg/m 2 IV over 2 hours; followed by 5-FU, 400 mg/m 2 IV bolus; followed by 5-FU, 600 mg/m 2 continuous IV infusion over 22 hours on days 1 and 2 every 2 weeks; (2) 5-FU, 250 to 300 mg/m 2 /day protracted continuous IV infusion until toxicity; (3) 5-FU, 2.6 to 3 g/m 2 IV over 24 hours every week for 6 weeks with or without LV, 20 to 500 mg/m 2 /day every week IV for 6 weeks with 2-week rest between cycles. Patients were to be followed every 3 to 6 weeks for 1 year. A total of 535 patients were randomized in the two studies at 94 centers. The primary endpoint in both studies was survival. The studies demonstrated a significant overall survival advantage for irinotecan compared with best supportive care (p=0.0001) and infusional 5-FU-based therapy (p=0.035) as shown in Figures 3 and 4. In Study 7, median survival for patients treated with irinotecan was 9.2 months compared with 6.5 months for patients receiving best supportive care. In Study 8, median survival for patients treated with irinotecan was 10.8 months compared with 8.5 months for patients receiving infusional 5-FU-based therapy. Multiple regression analyses determined that patients' baseline characteristics also had a significant effect on survival. When adjusted for performance status and other baseline prognostic factors, survival among patients treated with irinotecan remained significantly longer than in the control populations (p=0.001 for Study 7 and p=0.017 for Study 8). Measurements of pain, performance status, and weight loss were collected prospectively in the two studies; however, the plan for the analysis of these data was defined retrospectively. When comparing irinotecan with best supportive care in Study 7, this analysis showed a statistically significant advantage for irinotecan, with longer time to development of pain (6.9 months versus 2.0 months), time to performance status deterioration (5.7 months versus 3.3 months), and time to > 5% weight loss (6.4 months versus 4.2 months). Additionally, 33.3% (33/99) of patients with a baseline performance status of 1 or 2 showed an improvement in performance status when treated with irinotecan versus 11.3% (7/62) of patients receiving best supportive care (p=0.002). Because of the inclusion of patients with non-measurable disease, intent-to-treat response rates could not be assessed. Table 12.

At the start of each cycle of therapy, patients completed a questionnaire consisting of 30 questions, such as \"Did pain interfere with daily activities?\" (1 = Not at All, to 4 = Very Much) and \"Do you have any trouble taking a long walk?\" (Yes or No). The answers from the 30 questions were converted into 15 subscales, that were scored from 0 to 100, and the global health status subscale that was derived from two questions about the patient's sense of general well being in the past week. The results as summarized in Table 13 are based on patients' worst post-baseline scores. In Study 7, a multivariate analysis and univariate analyses of the individual subscales were performed and corrected for multivariate testing. Patients receiving irinotecan reported significantly better results for the global health status, on two of five functional subscales, and on four of nine symptom subscales. As expected, patients receiving irinotecan noted significantly more diarrhea than those receiving best supportive care. In Study 8, the multivariate analysis on all 15 subscales did not indicate a statistically significant difference between irinotecan and infusional 5-FU. Table 13. EORTC QLQ-C30: Mean Worst Post-Baseline Score a a For the five functional subscales and global health status subscale, higher scores imply better functioning, whereas, on the nine symptom subscales, higher scores imply more severe symptoms. The subscale scores of each patient were collected at each visit until the patient dropped out of the study.

Patients should have loperamide readily available to begin treatment for late diarrhea (generally occurring more than 24 hours after administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection). Begin loperamide at the first episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more frequent than normal. One dosage regimen for loperamide is 4 mg at the first onset of late diarrhea and then 2 mg every 2 hours until the patient is diarrhea-free for at least 12 hours. Loperamide is not recommended to be used for more than 48 consecutive hours at these doses, because of the risk of paralytic ileus. During the night, the patient may take 4 mg of loperamide every 4 hours. Patients should contact their physician if any of the following occur: diarrhea for the first time during treatment; black or bloody stools; symptoms of dehydration such as light headedness, dizziness, or faintness; inability to take fluids by mouth due to nausea or vomiting; or inability to get diarrhea under control within 24 hours. Patients should be warned about the potential for dizziness or visual disturbances which may occur within 24 hours following the administration of irinotecan hydrochloride injection. Explain the significance of routine blood cell counts. Instruct patients to monitor their temperature frequently and immediately report any occurrence of fever or infection. Irinotecan hydrochloride injection may cause fetal harm. Advise patients to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving this drug. Patients should be alerted to the possibility of alopecia.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Mechanism of Action: Lidocaine 5% Gel releases lidocaine from a mild acidic vehicle to stabilize the neuronal membrane by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for initiation and conduction of impulses, thereby effecting local anesthetic action. A mild acidic vehicle lowers pH to increase protection against alkaline irritants and to provide a favorable environment for healing. Pharmacokinetics: Lidocaine may be absorbed following topical administration to mucous membranes, its rate and extent of absorption depending upon the specific site of application, duration of exposure, concentration and total dosage. In general, the rate of absorption of local anesthetic agents following topical application occurs most rapidly after intratracheal administration. Lidocaine is also well-absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, but little intact drug appears in the circulation because of biotransformation in the liver. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver and metabolites and unchanged drug are excreted by the kidneys. Biotransformation includes oxidative N-dealkylation, ring hydroxylation, cleavage of the amide linkage and conjugation. N-dealkylation, a major pathway of biotransformation, yields the metabolites monoethylglycinexylidide and glycinexylidide. The pharmacological/ toxicological actions of these metabolites are similar to, but less potent than, those of lidocaine. Approximately 90% of lidocaine administered is excreted in the form of various metabolites and less than 10% is excreted unchanged. The primary metabolite in urine is a conjugate of 4-hydroxy-2, 6-dimethylaniline. The plasma binding of lidocaine is dependent on drug concentration and the fraction bound decreases with increasing concentration. At concentrations of 1 to 4 g of free base per mL, 60 to 80 percent of lidocaine is protein bound. Binding is also dependent on the plasma concentration of the alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. Lidocaine crosses the blood-brain and placental barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Studies of lidocaine metabolism following intravenous bolus injections have shown that the elimination half-life of this agent is typically 1.5 to 2 hours. Because of the rapid rate at which lidocaine is metabolized, any condition that affects liver function may alter lidocaine kinetics. The half-life may be prolonged two-fold or more in patients with liver dysfunction. Renal dysfunction does not affect lidocaine kinetics, but may increase the accumulation of metabolites. Factors such as acidosis and the use of CNS stimulants and depressants affect the CNS levels of lidocaine required to produce overt systemic effects. Objective adverse manifestations become increasingly apparent with increasing venous plasma levels above 6 g free base per mL. In the rhesus monkey, arterial blood levels of 18-21 g/mL have been shown to be threshold for convulsive activity."

      "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: Reduce resistance to new infections Exacerbate existing infections Increase the risk of disseminated infections Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If PredniSONE Tablets USP is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are nonimmune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles: If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with PredniSONE Tablets USP. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid PredniSONE Tablets USP use in the presence of such infections unless PredniSONE Tablets USP is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating PredniSONE Tablets USP in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, in patients with cerebral malaria. Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Information for Patients Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT \u00ae (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing\u2019s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

      "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: Reduce resistance to new infections Exacerbate existing infections Increase the risk of disseminated infections Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If PredniSONE Tablets USP is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are nonimmune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles: If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with PredniSONE Tablets USP. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid PredniSONE Tablets USP use in the presence of such infections unless PredniSONE Tablets USP is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating PredniSONE Tablets USP in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, in patients with cerebral malaria. Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Information for Patients Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT \u00ae (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing\u2019s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine besylate tablets are a calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of: Hypertension ( 1.1 ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Coronary Artery Disease ( 1.2 ) Chronic Stable Angina Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40% \u200b1.1 Hypertension Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic An g ina (Prinzmetal's or Variant An g ina ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.",

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reaction to amlodipine is edema which occurred in a dose related manner. Other adverse experiences not dose related but reported with an incidence >1% are fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oxford, at 1-844-508-1455, 8:00 am -4:30 pm ET, Monday \u2013 Friday or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine besylate tablets was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine besylate tablets were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine besylate tablets (N=1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine besylate tablets because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows: Amlodipine Placebo N=520 2.5mg N=275 5 mg N=296 10 mg N=268 Edema 1.8 3.0 10.8 0.6 Dizziness 1.1 3.4 3.4 1.5 Flushing 0.7 1.4 2.6 0.0 Palpitation 0.7 1.4 4.5 0.6 Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following: Amlodipine besylate tablets (%) Placebo (%) N=1730 N=1250 Fatigue 4.5 2.8 Nausea 2.9 1.9 Abdominal pain 1.6 0.3 Somnolence 1.4 0.6 For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table: Amlodipine besylate tablets Placebo Male=% (N=1218) Female=% (N=512) Male=% (N=914) Female=% (N=336) Edema 5.6 14.6 1.4 5.1 Flushing 1.5 4.5 0.3 0.9 Palpitations 1.4 3.3 0.9 0.9 Somnolence 1.3 1.6 0.8 0.3 The following events occurred in <1% but >0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis. Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia. General: allergic reaction, asthenia, 1 back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease. Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps, 1 myalgia. Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male 1 and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization. Respiratory System: dyspnea, 1 epistaxis. Skin and Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus, 1 rash, 1 rash erythematous, rash maculopapular. Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus. Urinary System: micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased. Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst. Hemopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Amlodipine besylate tablets therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. In the CAMELOT and PREVENT studies [ see Clinical Studies (14.4) ], the adverse event profile was similar to that reported previously (see above), with the most common adverse event being peripheral edema. 1 These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.",

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data based on post-marketing reports with amlodipine besylate tablets use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 and 20-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold). Amlodipine has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose [see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Clinical considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Data Animal Data No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (approximately 10 and 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area, respectively) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited available data from a published clinical lactation study reports that amlodipine is present in human milk at an estimated median relative infant dose of 4.2%. No adverse effects of amlodipine on the breastfed infant have been observed. There is no available information on the effects of amlodipine on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use Amlodipine besylate tablets (2.5 to 5 mg daily) are effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Effect of Amlodipine besylate tablets on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine besylate tablets are highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following: Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate tablets reduce the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine besylate tablets have been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro . This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine besylate tablets in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) angina. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine besylate tablets produce vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina. With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine besylate tablets is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine besylate tablets have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine besylate tablets have not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects. Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine besylate tablets do not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine besylate tablets and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine besylate tablets were administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks. Drug interactions Sildenafil: When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine besylate tablets is not altered by the presence of food. Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose. Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Drug interactions In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin. Impact of other dru g s on amlodipine Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine. CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co\u2011administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Impact of amlodipine on other dru g s Amlodipine is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase exposure to CYP3A substrates. Co-administered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time. Simvastatin: Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N=11) showed on an average of 40% increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Tacrolimus: A prospective study in healthy Chinese volunteers (N=9) with CYP3A5 expressers showed a 2.5\u2011to 4-fold increase in tacrolimus exposure when concomitantly administered with amlodipine compared to tacrolimus alone. This finding was not observed in CYP3A5 non-expressers (N= 6). However, a 3-fold increase in plasma exposure to tacrolimus in a renal transplant patient (CYP3A5 non-expresser) upon initiation of amlodipine for the treatment of post-transplant hypertension resulting in reduction of tacrolimus dose has been reported. Irrespective of the CYP3A5 genotype status, the possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 12.4 Pediatric Patients Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine besylate tablets between 1.25 mg and 20 mg.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Effects in Hypertension Adult Patients The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients. Pediatric Patients Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine besylate tablets 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults. 14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine besylate tablets in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine besylate tablets, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 5 mg. Amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm). 14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p<0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine besylate tablets and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement. 14.4 Effects in Documented Coronary Artery Disease In PREVENT, 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease were randomized to amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo and followed for 3 years. Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD. CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main coronary disease and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%. Patients (76% males, 89% Caucasian, 93% enrolled at U.S. sites, 89% with a history of angina, 52% without PCI, 4% with PCI and no stent, and 44% with a stent) were randomized to double-blind treatment with either amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89%), statins (83%), beta-blockers (74%), nitroglycerin (50%), anti-coagulants (40%), and diuretics (32%), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events: hospitalization for angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease. A total of 110 (16.6%) and 151 (23.1%) first events occurred in the amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.540\u20130.884, p = 0.003). The primary endpoint is summarized in Figure 1 below. The outcome of this study was largely derived from the prevention of hospitalizations for angina and the prevention of revascularization procedures (see Table 1 ). Effects in various subgroups are shown in Figure 2 . In an angiographic substudy (n=274) conducted within CAMELOT, there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo on the change of atheroma volume in the coronary artery as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. F igure 1 - Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Composite Clinical Outcomes for Amlodipine versus Placebo Figure 2 \u2013 Effects on Primary Endpoint of Amlodipine Besylate Tablets versus Placebo across Sub- Groups Table 1 below summarizes the significant composite endpoint and clinical outcomes from the composites of the primary endpoint. The other components of the primary endpoint including cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease did not demonstrate a significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo. Table 1.

In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular ejection fraction. In a long-term (follow-up at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo- controlled mortality/morbidity study of amlodipine besylate tablets 5 to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n=931) or IV (n=222) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, amlodipine besylate tablets had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of heart failure. Total combined all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222/571 (39%) for patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 246/583 (42%) for patients on placebo; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25% of the endpoints in the study. Another study (PRAISE-2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%), to placebo (n=827) or amlodipine besylate tablets (n=827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on amlodipine besylate tablets). With amlodipine besylate tablets there were more reports of pulmonary edema."

It acts by restricting the synthesis of folic acid required by bacteria for growth, by its competition with para-aminobenzoic acid. There is no clinical data available on the degree and rate of systemic absorption of this product when applied to the skin or scalp. However, significant absorption of sodium sulfacetamide through the skin has been reported. The following in vitro data is available, but the clinical significance is unknown. Organisms that show susceptibility to sodium sulfacetamide are: Streptococci, Staphylococci, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Salmonella species, Proteus vulgaris, Nocardia and Actinomyces. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids."

      "WARNINGS: Sulfonamides are known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome in hypersensitive individuals. Stevens-Johnson syndrome also has been reported following the use of sodium sulfacetamide topically. Cases of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus from topical sulfacetamide also have been reported. In one of these cases, there was a fatal outcome. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE. General: Nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi, may proliferate with the use of this preparation. Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. If the use of this product produces signs of hypersensitivity or other untoward reactions, discontinue use of the preparation. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved. Systemic absorption of topical sulfonamides is greater following application to large, infected, abraded, denuded, or severely burned areas. Under these circumstances, any of the adverse effects produced by the systemic administration of these agents could potentially occur, and appropriate observations and laboratory determinations should be performed. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility. Information for Patients: Patients should discontinue the use of this product if the condition becomes worse or if a rash develops in the area being treated or elsewhere. The use of this product also should be discontinued promptly, and the physician notified if any arthritis, fever, or sores in the mouth develop. Avoid contact with eyes, lips and mucous membranes. Drug Interactions: This product is incompatible with silver preparations. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies for carcinogenic potential have not been performed on this product to date. Studies on reproduction and fertility also have not been performed. Chromosomal nondisjunction has been reported in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, following application of sodium sulfacetamide. The significance of this finding to the topical use of sodium sulfacetamide in the human is unknown. Pregnancy: Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can affect reproduction capacity or cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. This product should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed or when potential benefits outweigh potential hazards to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this product is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children under the age of 12 years have not been established.",

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%.

      "Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged.

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch 5% performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours. Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value <0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Risk of Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue lidocaine patch 5% and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen. Accidental Exposure in Children Even a used lidocaine patch 5% contains a large amount of lidocaine (at least 665 mg). The potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used lidocaine patch 5%, although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated. It is important for patients to store and dispose of lidocaine patch 5% out of the reach of children, pets, and others (see HANDLING AND DISPOSAL). Excessive Dosing Excessive dosing by applying lidocaine patch 5% to larger areas or for longer than the recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood concentrations, leading to serious adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions). Lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 mcg/mL. The blood concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination. Longer duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller patients, or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of lidocaine. With recommended dosing of lidocaine patch 5%, the average peak blood concentration is about 0.13 mcg/mL, but concentrations higher than 0.25 mcg/mL have been observed in some individuals."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hepatic Disease Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally. Allergic Reactions Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. However, lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain. Non-intact Skin Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption. Lidocaine patch 5% is only recommended for use on intact skin. External Heat Sources Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over lidocaine patch 5% is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma lidocaine levels. Eye Exposure The contact of lidocaine patch 5% with eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns. Information for Patients Methemoglobinemia Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue.

Local Anesthetics When lidocaine patch 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered. Drugs That May Cause Methemoglobinemia When Used with Lidocaine Patch 5% Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics: Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitric oxide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, tetracaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid, sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants Phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, quinine, sulfasalazine Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%.

Impairment of Fertility The effect of lidocaine patch 5% on fertility has not been studied. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in pregnancy. Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, lidocaine patch 5% should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in labor and delivery. Lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should lidocaine patch 5% be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered.

These reactions are generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within a few minutes to hours. Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm, pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Other Adverse Events Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including: Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence, taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and tremor. Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine patch 5% are unlikely, due to the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold, or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest).

Smaller areas of treatment are recommended in a debilitated patient, or a patient with impaired elimination. If irritation or a burning sensation occurs during application, remove the patch(es) and do not reapply until the irritation subsides. When lidocaine patch 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered.

Load the bags onto a scale and/or blood mixing device according to your institution's SOP. Ensure that the whole blood bag and the sample bag are lower than the donor's arm. 4. Close blue clamp B. 5. Apply a blood pressure cuff or a tourniquet to the donor's arm. 6. Prepare the venipuncture site. 7. Twist the needle cap until the resistance stops and then pull the needle cap straight off. 8. Perform the venipuncture according to your institution's SOP. 9. Open blue clamp B. 10. Position the sample/diversion bag with blue clamp B at the top and the sample tube holder/luer adapter at the bottom (see Figure 1 ). Allow the desired volume of whole blood to flow into the sample/diversion bag. The nominal volume of the sample bag is 60 mL. When the volume reaches the marking, approximately 40 mL has been collected. 11. Close blue clamp B. 12. Break CLIKTIP D to allow the whole blood to flow into the whole blood bag. Bend the CLIKTIP in both directions to ensure that you break it completely. 13. Seal the sample/diversion tubing as near as possible to Y connector A. Seal the tubing according to your institution's SOP. 14. Invert the sample/diversion bag and transfer donor blood samples from the sample/diversion bag, using evacuated blood collection tubes. Transfer samples as soon as possible after venipuncture to avoid possible clot formation in the sample/diversion bag. a. Hold the sample/diversion bag and sample tube holder/luer adapter in one hand with blue clamp B positioned at the bottom (see Figure 2 ). b. Using the other hand, insert a blood collection tube firmly into the sample tube holder/luer adapter. After filling the blood collection tube, remove the tube from the sample tube holder. Repeat the process to take additional samples. 15. Mix the whole blood and the anticoagulant during collection according to your institution's SOP. 16. Collect the target volume of blood \u00b1 10%, as specified on the whole blood bag label. 17. Close white clamp E and perform one of the following steps: If you made a knot in the collection tubing in step 1, tighten the knot firmly. If you did not make a knot in step 1, seal the collection tubing near CLIKTIP D. 18. Hold the needle hub and then slide the NIP partially over the needle hub (see Figure 3 ). 19. Gently pull on the tubing to withdraw the needle from the donor's arm and into the NIP until the needle locks securely (see Figure 4 ). 20. Seal the collection tubing near CLIKTIP D if you did not do so in step 17. Disconnect the sealed tubing that includes the needle and the sampling assembly. Dispose of the needle, the NIP, and the sample tube holder safely according to your institution's SOP and/or local regulations. 21. Immediately after collection is complete, invert the whole blood bag several times to thoroughly mix the whole blood and the anticoagulant. 22. If required, strip the blood in the collection tubing into the whole blood bag according to your institution's SOP. 23. Seal and disconnect the collection tubing between 1 in and 2 in (2.5 cm and 5.0 cm) away from the whole blood bag. Dispose of the collection tubing safely according to your institution's SOP and/or local regulations. 24. Place the whole blood unit into a temperature-controlled environment according to your institution's SOP. 25. Pack and transport the whole blood unit to the processing laboratory according to your institution's SOP.

After processing, remove the plasma bag, the plasma cryoprecipitate reduced bag, the residual leukocyte bag, and the IPU bag from the organizer and handle them according to your institution's SOP. Note : You must rest and agitate the IPU prior to platelet pooling. For conditions for resting and agitating the IPU, see the platelet pooling set instructions for use. 2. Prepare a leukoreduction rack with a head height of at least 43\u00bd in (110 cm). 3. Remove the RBC bag from the organizer. 4. Hang the RBC bag from the leukoreduction rack so that the filter hangs vertically. 5. Open blue clamp G. 6. Break CLIKTIP H. 7. Break CLIKTIP J. 8. Drain all of the additive solution through the filter and into the whole blood bag. 9. Close blue clamp G. 10. Gently mix the additive solution with the RBC unit in the whole blood bag. 11. Hang the whole blood bag on the leukoreduction rack. 12. Ensure that the tubing is free of kinks or other obstructions. 13. Open blue clamp G and allow the mixture of red blood cells and additive solution to flow through the leukoreduction filter. Do not squeeze the whole blood bag to increase the draining rate. Filtration is complete when the inlet side of the leukoreduction filter collapses and the red blood cells drain from the inlet side of the filter. 14. Seal the RBC tubing below the leukoreduction filter and disconnect the RBC bag. Ensure that the filter remains in a vertical position while you seal the tubing, as this prevents the loss of red blood cells. 15. Dispose of the whole blood bag and filter assembly safely according to your institution's SOP and/or local regulations. 16. Seal the line for sampling segments according to your institution's SOP. 17. Store the RBC product according to your institution's SOP. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever the solution and container permit.

      "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: Reduce resistance to new infections Exacerbate existing infections Increase the risk of disseminated infections Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If PredniSONE Tablets USP is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are nonimmune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles: If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with PredniSONE Tablets USP. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid PredniSONE Tablets USP use in the presence of such infections unless PredniSONE Tablets USP is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating PredniSONE Tablets USP in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, in patients with cerebral malaria. Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Information for Patients Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT \u00ae (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing\u2019s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine besylate tablets are a calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of: \u2022 Hypertension ( 1.1 ) o Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. \u2022 Coronary Artery Disease ( 1.2 ) o Chronic Stable Angina o Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) o Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40% \u200b1.1 Hypertension Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic An g ina (Prinzmetal's or Variant An g ina ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.",

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reaction to amlodipine is edema which occurred in a dose related manner. Other adverse experiences not dose related but reported with an incidence >1% are fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oxford, at 1-844-508-1455, 8:00 am -4:30 pm ET, Monday \u2013 Friday or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine besylate tablets was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine besylate tablets were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine besylate tablets (N=1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine besylate tablets because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows: Amlodipine Placebo N=520 2.5mg N=275 5 mg N=296 10 mg N=268 Edema 1.8 3.0 10.8 0.6 Dizziness 1.1 3.4 3.4 1.5 Flushing 0.7 1.4 2.6 0.0 Palpitation 0.7 1.4 4.5 0.6 Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following: Amlodipine besylate tablets (%) Placebo (%) N=1730 N=1250 Fatigue 4.5 2.8 Nausea 2.9 1.9 Abdominal pain 1.6 0.3 Somnolence 1.4 0.6 For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table: Amlodipine besylate tablets Placebo Male=% (N=1218) Female=% (N=512) Male=% (N=914) Female=% (N=336) Edema 5.6 14.6 1.4 5.1 Flushing 1.5 4.5 0.3 0.9 Palpitations 1.4 3.3 0.9 0.9 Somnolence 1.3 1.6 0.8 0.3 The following events occurred in <1% but >0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis. Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia. General: allergic reaction, asthenia, 1 back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease. Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps, 1 myalgia. Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male 1 and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization. Respiratory System: dyspnea, 1 epistaxis. Skin and Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus, 1 rash, 1 rash erythematous, rash maculopapular. Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus. Urinary System: micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased. Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst. Hemopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Amlodipine besylate tablets therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. In the CAMELOT and PREVENT studies [ see Clinical Studies (14.4) ], the adverse event profile was similar to that reported previously (see above), with the most common adverse event being peripheral edema. 1 These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.",

CYP3A Inducers No information is available on the quantitative effects of CYP3A inducers on amlodipine. Blood pressure should be closely monitored when amlodipine is co-administered with CYP3A inducers. Sildenafil Monitor for hypotension when sildenafil is co-administered with amlodipine [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2) ]. 7.2. Impact of Amlodipine on Other Drugs Simvastatin Co-administration of simvastatin with amlodipine increases the systemic exposure of simvastatin. Limit the dose of simvastatin in patients on amlodipine to 20 mg daily [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. Immunosuppressants Amlodipine may increase the systemic exposure of cyclosporine or tacrolimus when co-administered. Frequent monitoring of trough blood levels of cyclosporine and tacrolimus is recommended and adjust the dose when appropriate [ see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data based on post-marketing reports with amlodipine besylate tablets use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 and 20-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold). Amlodipine has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose [see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Clinical considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Data Animal Data No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (approximately 10 and 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area, respectively) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited available data from a published clinical lactation study reports that amlodipine is present in human milk at an estimated median relative infant dose of 4.2%. No adverse effects of amlodipine on the breastfed infant have been observed. There is no available information on the effects of amlodipine on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use Amlodipine besylate tablets (2.5 to 5 mg daily) are effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Effect of Amlodipine besylate tablets on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Elderly patients have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase of AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required [ see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ]."

In humans, experience with intentional overdosage of amlodipine besylate tablets is limited. Single oral doses of amlodipine maleate equivalent to 40 mg amlodipine/kg and 100 mg amlodipine/kg in mice and rats, respectively, caused deaths. Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine besylate tablets are highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following: Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate tablets reduce the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine besylate tablets have been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro . This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine besylate tablets in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) angina. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine besylate tablets produce vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina. With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine besylate tablets is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine besylate tablets have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine besylate tablets have not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects. Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine besylate tablets do not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine besylate tablets and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine besylate tablets were administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks. Drug interactions Sildenafil: When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine besylate tablets is not altered by the presence of food. Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose. Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Drug interactions In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin. Impact of other drugs on amlodipine Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine. CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co\u2011administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Impact of amlodipine on other drugs Amlodipine is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase exposure to CYP3A substrates. Co-administered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time. Simvastatin: Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N=11) showed on an average of 40% increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Tacrolimus: A prospective study in healthy Chinese volunteers (N=9) with CYP3A5 expressers showed a 2.5\u2011to 4-fold increase in tacrolimus exposure when concomitantly administered with amlodipine compared to tacrolimus alone. This finding was not observed in CYP3A5 non-expressers (N= 6). However, a 3-fold increase in plasma exposure to tacrolimus in a renal transplant patient (CYP3A5 non-expresser) upon initiation of amlodipine for the treatment of post-transplant hypertension resulting in reduction of tacrolimus dose has been reported. Irrespective of the CYP3A5 genotype status, the possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 12.4 Pediatric Patients Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine besylate tablets between 1.25 mg and 20 mg.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Effects in Hypertension Adult Patients The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients. Pediatric Patients Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine besylate tablets 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults. 14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine besylate tablets in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine besylate tablets, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 5 mg. Amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm). 14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p<0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine besylate tablets and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement. 14.4 Effects in Documented Coronary Artery Disease In PREVENT, 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease were randomized to amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo and followed for 3 years. Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD. CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main coronary disease and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%. Patients (76% males, 89% Caucasian, 93% enrolled at U.S. sites, 89% with a history of angina, 52% without PCI, 4% with PCI and no stent, and 44% with a stent) were randomized to double-blind treatment with either amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89%), statins (83%), beta-blockers (74%), nitroglycerin (50%), anti-coagulants (40%), and diuretics (32%), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events: hospitalization for angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease. A total of 110 (16.6%) and 151 (23.1%) first events occurred in the amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.540\u20130.884, p = 0.003). The primary endpoint is summarized in Figure 1 below. The outcome of this study was largely derived from the prevention of hospitalizations for angina and the prevention of revascularization procedures (see Table 1 ). Effects in various subgroups are shown in Figure 2 . In an angiographic substudy (n=274) conducted within CAMELOT, there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo on the change of atheroma volume in the coronary artery as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. Figure 1 - Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Composite Clinical Outcomes for Amlodipine versus Placebo Figure 2 \u2013 Effects on Primary Endpoint of Amlodipine Besylate Tablets versus Placebo across Sub- Groups Table 1 below summarizes the significant composite endpoint and clinical outcomes from the composites of the primary endpoint. The other components of the primary endpoint including cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease did not demonstrate a significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo. Table 1. Incidence of Significant Clinical Outcomes for CAMELOT * Total patients with these events Clinical Outcomes N(%) Amlodipine besylate tablets (N=663) Placebo (N=655) Risk Reduction (p-value) Composite CV Endpoint 110 (16.6) 151 (23.1) 31% (0.003) Hospitalization for Angina* 51 84 42% (7.7) (12.8) (0.002) Coronary Revascularization* 78 103 27% (11.8) (15.7) (0.033) figure-1 figure-2 14.5 Studies in Patients with Heart Failure Amlodipine besylate tablets have been compared to placebo in four 8 to 12 week studies of patients with NYHA Class II/III heart failure, involving a total of 697 patients. In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular ejection fraction. In a long-term (follow-up at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo- controlled mortality/morbidity study of amlodipine besylate tablets 5 to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n=931) or IV (n=222) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, amlodipine besylate tablets had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of heart failure. Total combined all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222/571 (39%) for patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 246/583 (42%) for patients on placebo; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25% of the endpoints in the study. Another study (PRAISE-2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%), to placebo (n=827) or amlodipine besylate tablets (n=827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on amlodipine besylate tablets). With amlodipine besylate tablets there were more reports of pulmonary edema."

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine besylate tablets are a calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of: Hypertension ( 1.1 ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Coronary Artery Disease ( 1.2 ) Chronic Stable Angina Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40% \u200b1.1 Hypertension Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic An g ina (Prinzmetal's or Variant An g ina ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.",

( 2.2 ) I mportant Limitation: Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients. (2.2) 2.1 Adults The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine besylate tablets is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine besylate tablets to other antihypertensive therapy. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titrate more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently. Angina: The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect . Coronary artery disease: The recommended dose range for patients with coronary artery disease is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [ see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. 2.2 Children The effective antihypertensive oral dose in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reaction to amlodipine is edema which occurred in a dose related manner. Other adverse experiences not dose related but reported with an incidence >1% are fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oxford, at 1-844-508-1455, 8:00 am -4:30 pm ET, Monday \u2013 Friday or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine besylate tablets was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine besylate tablets were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine besylate tablets (N=1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine besylate tablets because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows: Amlodipine Placebo N=520 2.5mg N=275 5 mg N=296 10 mg N=268 Edema 1.8 3.0 10.8 0.6 Dizziness 1.1 3.4 3.4 1.5 Flushing 0.7 1.4 2.6 0.0 Palpitation 0.7 1.4 4.5 0.6 Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following: Amlodipine besylate tablets (%) Placebo (%) N=1730 N=1250 Fatigue 4.5 2.8 Nausea 2.9 1.9 Abdominal pain 1.6 0.3 Somnolence 1.4 0.6 For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table: Amlodipine besylate tablets Placebo Male=% (N=1218) Female=% (N=512) Male=% (N=914) Female=% (N=336) Edema 5.6 14.6 1.4 5.1 Flushing 1.5 4.5 0.3 0.9 Palpitations 1.4 3.3 0.9 0.9 Somnolence 1.3 1.6 0.8 0.3 The following events occurred in <1% but >0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis. Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia. General: allergic reaction, asthenia, 1 back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease. Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps, 1 myalgia. Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male 1 and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization. Respiratory System: dyspnea, 1 epistaxis. Skin and Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus, 1 rash, 1 rash erythematous, rash maculopapular. Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus. Urinary System: micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased. Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst. Hemopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Amlodipine besylate tablets therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. In the CAMELOT and PREVENT studies [ see Clinical Studies (14.4) ], the adverse event profile was similar to that reported previously (see above), with the most common adverse event being peripheral edema. 1 These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.",

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data based on post-marketing reports with amlodipine besylate tablets use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 and 20-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold). Amlodipine has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose [see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Clinical considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Data Animal Data No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (approximately 10 and 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area, respectively) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited available data from a published clinical lactation study reports that amlodipine is present in human milk at an estimated median relative infant dose of 4.2%. No adverse effects of amlodipine on the breastfed infant have been observed. There is no available information on the effects of amlodipine on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use Amlodipine besylate tablets (2.5 to 5 mg daily) are effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Effect of Amlodipine besylate tablets on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine besylate tablets are highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Amlodipine besylate tablets are the besylate salt of amlodipine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker. Amlodipine besylate is chemically described as 3-Ethyl-5-methyl (\u00b1)-2-[(2-aminoethoxy)methyl]-4-(2-chlorophenyl)-1,4-dihydro-6-methyl-3,5-pyridinedicarboxylate, monobenzenesulphonate. Its empirical formula is C 20 H 25 ClN 2 O 5 \u2022C 6 H 6 O 3 S, and its structural formula is: Amlodipine besylate is a white crystalline powder with a molecular weight of 567.1. It is slightly soluble in water and sparingly soluble in ethanol. Amlodipine besylate tablets USP are formulated as white tablets equivalent to 2.5, 5, and 10 mg of amlodipine for oral administration. In addition to the active ingredient, amlodipine besylate, each tablet contains the following inactive ingredients: dibasic calcium phosphate anhydrous, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and sodium starch glycolate. structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following: Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate tablets reduce the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine besylate tablets have been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro . This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine besylate tablets in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) angina. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine besylate tablets produce vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina. With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine besylate tablets is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine besylate tablets have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine besylate tablets have not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects. Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine besylate tablets do not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine besylate tablets and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine besylate tablets were administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks. Drug interactions Sildenafil: When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine besylate tablets is not altered by the presence of food. Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose. Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Drug interactions In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin. Impact of other dru g s on amlodipine Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine. CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co\u2011administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Impact of amlodipine on other dru g s Amlodipine is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase exposure to CYP3A substrates. Co-administered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time. Simvastatin: Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N=11) showed on an average of 40% increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Tacrolimus: A prospective study in healthy Chinese volunteers (N=9) with CYP3A5 expressers showed a 2.5\u2011to 4-fold increase in tacrolimus exposure when concomitantly administered with amlodipine compared to tacrolimus alone. This finding was not observed in CYP3A5 non-expressers (N= 6). However, a 3-fold increase in plasma exposure to tacrolimus in a renal transplant patient (CYP3A5 non-expresser) upon initiation of amlodipine for the treatment of post-transplant hypertension resulting in reduction of tacrolimus dose has been reported. Irrespective of the CYP3A5 genotype status, the possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 12.4 Pediatric Patients Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine besylate tablets between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults.",

Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose. Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Drug interactions In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin. Impact of other dru g s on amlodipine Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine. CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co\u2011administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Impact of amlodipine on other dru g s Amlodipine is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase exposure to CYP3A substrates. Co-administered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time. Simvastatin: Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N=11) showed on an average of 40% increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Tacrolimus: A prospective study in healthy Chinese volunteers (N=9) with CYP3A5 expressers showed a 2.5\u2011to 4-fold increase in tacrolimus exposure when concomitantly administered with amlodipine compared to tacrolimus alone. This finding was not observed in CYP3A5 non-expressers (N= 6). However, a 3-fold increase in plasma exposure to tacrolimus in a renal transplant patient (CYP3A5 non-expresser) upon initiation of amlodipine for the treatment of post-transplant hypertension resulting in reduction of tacrolimus dose has been reported. Irrespective of the CYP3A5 genotype status, the possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ].",
      "12.4 Pediatric Patients Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine besylate tablets between 1.25 mg and 20 mg. Weight-adjusted clearance and volume of distribution were similar to values in adults."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following: Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate tablets reduce the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine besylate tablets have been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro . This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine besylate tablets in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) angina."
    ],
    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine besylate tablets produce vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina. With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine besylate tablets is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine besylate tablets have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine besylate tablets have not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects. Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine besylate tablets do not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine besylate tablets and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine besylate tablets were administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks. Drug interactions Sildenafil: When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Effects in Hypertension Adult Patients The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients. Pediatric Patients Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine besylate tablets 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults. 14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine besylate tablets in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine besylate tablets, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 5 mg. Amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm). 14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p<0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine besylate tablets and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement. 14.4 Effects in Documented Coronary Artery Disease In PREVENT, 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease were randomized to amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo and followed for 3 years. Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD. CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main coronary disease and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%. Patients (76% males, 89% Caucasian, 93% enrolled at U.S. sites, 89% with a history of angina, 52% without PCI, 4% with PCI and no stent, and 44% with a stent) were randomized to double-blind treatment with either amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89%), statins (83%), beta-blockers (74%), nitroglycerin (50%), anti-coagulants (40%), and diuretics (32%), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events: hospitalization for angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease. A total of 110 (16.6%) and 151 (23.1%) first events occurred in the amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.540\u20130.884, p = 0.003). The primary endpoint is summarized in Figure 1 below. The outcome of this study was largely derived from the prevention of hospitalizations for angina and the prevention of revascularization procedures (see Table 1 ). Effects in various subgroups are shown in Figure 2 . In an angiographic substudy (n=274) conducted within CAMELOT, there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo on the change of atheroma volume in the coronary artery as assessed by intravascular ultrasound.

The other components of the primary endpoint including cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease did not demonstrate a significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo.

In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular ejection fraction. In a long-term (follow-up at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo- controlled mortality/morbidity study of amlodipine besylate tablets 5 to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n=931) or IV (n=222) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, amlodipine besylate tablets had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of heart failure. Total combined all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222/571 (39%) for patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 246/583 (42%) for patients on placebo; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25% of the endpoints in the study. Another study (PRAISE-2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%), to placebo (n=827) or amlodipine besylate tablets (n=827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on amlodipine besylate tablets). With amlodipine besylate tablets there were more reports of pulmonary edema."

There may be new information. This information does not replace talking with your doctor. If you have any questions about amlodipine besylate tablets , ask your doctor. Your doctor will know if amlodipine besylate tablets are right for you. What is amlodipine besylate tablets? Amlodipine besylate tablets are a type of medicine known as a calcium channel blocker (CCB). It is used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension) and a type of chest pain called angina. It can be used by itself or with other medicines to treat these conditions. High Blood Pressure (hypertension) High blood pressure comes from blood pushing too hard against your blood vessels. Amlodipine besylate tablets relax your blood vessels, which lets your blood flow more easily and helps lower your blood pressure. Drugs that lower blood pressure lower your risk of having a stroke or heart attack. Angina Angina is a pain or discomfort that keeps coming back when part of your heart does not get enough blood. Angina feels like a pressing or squeezing pain, usually in your chest under the breastbone. Sometimes you can feel it in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaws, or back. Amlodipine besylate tablets can relieve this pain. Who should not use amlodipine besylate tablets? Do not use amlodipine besylate tablets if you are allergic to amlodipine (the active ingredient in amlodipine besylate tablets ), or to the inactive ingredients. Your doctor or pharmacist can give you a list of these ingredients. What should I tell my doctor before taking amlodipine besylate tablets? Tell your doctor about any prescription and non-prescription medicines you are taking, including natural or herbal remedies. Tell your doctor if you: ever had heart disease ever had liver problems are pregnant, or plan to become pregnant. Your doctor will decide if amlodipine besylate tablets are the best treatment for you. are breastfeeding. Amlodipine besylate passes into your milk. How should I take amlodipine besylate tablets? Take amlodipine besylate tablets once a day, with or without food. It may be easier to take your dose if you do it at the same time every day, such as with breakfast or dinner, or at bedtime.

Sodium sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity while sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Chemically sodium sulfacetamide is N-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl]-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is: struct"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids."

      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: SODIUM SULFACETAMIDE 10% - SULFUR 5% CLEANSER is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur or any other component of this preparation. SODIUM SULFACETAMIDE 10% - SULFUR 5% CLEANSER is not to be used by patients with kidney disease."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved. Sulfonamides are known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome in hypersensitive individuals. Stevens-Johnson syndrome also has been reported following the use of sodium sulfacetamide topically. Cases of drug induced systemic lupus erythematosus from topical sulfacetamide also have been reported. In one of these cases, there was a fatal outcome. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE. General: If irritation develops, use of the product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Pregnancy: Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with SODIUM SULFACETAMIDE 10% - SULFUR 5% CLEANSER. It is also not known whether SODIUM SULFACETAMIDE 10% - SULFUR 5% CLEANSER can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. SODIUM SULFACETAMIDE 10% - SULFUR 5% CLEANSER should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether sodium sulfacetamide is excreted in human milk following topicaI use of SODIUM SULFACETAMIDE 10% - SULFUR 5% CLEANSER. However, small amounts of orally administered sulfonamides have been reported to be excreted in human milk. In view of this and because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when SODIUM SULFACETAMIDE 10% - SULFUR 5% CLEANSER is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children under the age of 12 has not been established."

      "DESCRIPTION Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection in the Cryovac plastic container for intravenous use is composed of clindamycin phosphate equivalent to 600 and 900 mg of clindamycin premixed with 5% dextrose as a sterile solution. Disodium edetate has been added at a concentration of 0.04 mg/mL. The pH has been adjusted with sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid. Clindamycin is a semisynthetic antibiotic produced by a 7(S)-chloro-substitution of the 7(R)-hydroxyl group of the parent compound lincomycin. The chemical name of clindamycin phosphate is L- threo-\u03b1 -D- galacto - Octopyranoside, methyl-7-chloro-6,7,8-trideoxy-6-[[(1-methyl-4-propyl-2- pyrrolidinyl) carbonyl] amino]-1-thio-, 2-(dihydrogen phosphate), (2 S-trans )-. The molecular formula is C 18 H 34 CIN 2 0 8 PS and the molecular weight is 504.97. The structural formula is represented below: The plastic container is fabricated from a specially designed multilayer plastic, M312A material. Solutions in contact with the plastic container can leach out certain of its chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the plastic has been confirmed in tests in animals according to the USP biological tests for plastic containers, as well as by tissue culture toxicity studies. chemical-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Distribution Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is converted to active clindamycin. By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin. Excretion Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. Specific Populations Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4 hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function 1 . Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with PMA \u226432 weeks, or >32 to \u226440 weeks Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in body weight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA). The dosing regimens for pediatric patients \u226432 weeks PMA (5 mg/kg) and >32 to \u226440 weeks PMA (7 mg/kg), both administered intravenously every 8 hours, achieve exposures comparable to therapeutic exposures in adults (weighing 70 kg) administered clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours ( Table 1 ).

Obese Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to Less than 18 Years and Obese Adults Aged 18 to 20 Years An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and obese adults aged 18 to 20 years demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution, normalized by total body weight, are comparable regardless of obesity. Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections (see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ): Gram-positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Anaerobic Bacteria Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium necrophorum Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Prevotella melaninogenica The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for clindamycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of clindamycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive Bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus anginosus Streptococcus mitis Streptococcus oralis Anaerobic Bacteria Actinomyces israelii Clostridium clostridioforme Eggerthella lenta Finegoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Cutibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https://www.fda.gov/STIC."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the BOXED WARNING , before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin). Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below: Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae , other streptococci (except E. faecalis ), and Staphylococcus aureus . Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus , and anaerobes. Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes. Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms. Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus , streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis ), and susceptible anaerobes. Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection and other antibacterial drugs, Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNING . Clostridioides difficile - Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile - associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . In case of such an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue treatment permanently and institute appropriate therapy. A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens. Nephrotoxicity Clindamycin is potentially nephrotoxic and cases with acute kidney injury have been reported. Consider monitoring of renal function particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or those taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In case of acute kidney injury, discontinue clindamycin when no other etiology is identified. Usage in Meningitis Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency. Clindamycin should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Clindamycin should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals. Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy. The use of clindamycin may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms- particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. Clindamycin should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10 to 60 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. Clindamycin dosage modification is not necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease. Prescribing clindamycin in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed. Drug Interactions Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness. In vitro studies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities. Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Nursing Mothers Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use When clindamycin sterile solution is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Usage in Newborns and Infants The potential for the toxic effect in the pediatric population from chemicals that may leach from the single dose premixed IV preparation in plastic has not been evaluated (see WARNINGS ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridioides difficile ) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (>60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration."

Adults Parenteral (IV Administration) Serious infections due to aerobic gram-positive cocci and the more susceptible anaerobes (NOT generally including Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus species and Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens ): 600 to 1,200 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. More severe infections, particularly those due to proven or suspected Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus species, or Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens : 1,200 to 2,700 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. For more serious infections, these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations due to either aerobes or anaerobes these doses may be increased. Doses of as much as 4,800 mg daily have been given intravenously to adults. See IV Infusion Rates section below. Alternatively, drug may be administered in the form of a single rapid infusion of the first dose followed by continuous IV infusion as follows: Table 2.

      "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: Reduce resistance to new infections Exacerbate existing infections Increase the risk of disseminated infections Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If PredniSONE Tablets USP is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are nonimmune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles: If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with PredniSONE Tablets USP. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid PredniSONE Tablets USP use in the presence of such infections unless PredniSONE Tablets USP is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating PredniSONE Tablets USP in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, in patients with cerebral malaria. Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Information for Patients Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT \u00ae (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing\u2019s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

NOTE: Alternatively, steps 2.6.1., 2.6.2., and 2.6.3. (above) may be performed at any time during bag preparation or after the blood is collected into the diversion pouch. 2.7. Suspend the collection bag as far as possible below the donor's arm. 2.8. Apply blood pressure cuff or tourniquet to donor's arm. Disinfect site of phlebotomy. If blood pressure cuff is used, inflate to approximately 60 mmHg. 2.9. Remove the needle cover and perform phlebotomy. Remove the temporary clamp on the donor tubing to permit blood flow into the Diversion Blood Sampling Arm pouch. 2.9.1. CAUTION: Do not touch the needle after removing the needle cover. 2.9.2. CAUTION: Assure that the White Clamp below the pouch is closed prior to initiating phlebotomy. 2.10. Secure the needle safety device in place following the device instructions provided on the reverse side. 2.11. Secure donor tubing to donor's arm. 2.12. Position the diversion pouch with the notches up and the Tube Holder/Luer Adapter assembly (or port cap) down. When the level of blood in the pouch is approximately in line with the notches, the diversion pouch is full (Fig. 3a). 2.12.1. NOTE: The approximate fill volume of the pouch at the notches is 35 mL. 2.13. Permanently seal the tubing between the \"Y\" and the diversion pouch to maintain a closed system using an aluminum clip or a tube sealer approved for use with tubing connected to a donor (Fig. 3b). 2.13.1. CAUTION: Do not use a dielectric tube sealer to seal the tubing while the needle is connected to the donor's body unless it is approved for such a purpose. 2.14. To initiate blood flow into the collection bag, break the CLIKTIP between the \"Y\" and the collection bag. 2.15. To avoid clot formation, collect samples as soon as possible from the diversion pouch as follows (Fig. 3b). 2.15.1. CAUTION: Do not collect donor test samples until the tubing between the \"Y\" and the diversion pouch is permanently sealed. 2.15.2. Open the White Clamp on the tubing below the pouch to open the pathway for sampling. 2.15.3. Position the diversion pouch with the notches up and the Tube Holder/Luer Adapter assembly downward. Assure that any air in the pouch is at the top and will not enter the blood collection tubes. 2.15.4. Insert blood collection tube firmly into the tube holder; when full, remove sample tube from holder. Repeat to collect additional samples. 2.15.5. NOTE: The pouch may be removed after the donor test samples are collected. A second seal must be made between the diversion pouch and the permanent seal prior to removing the pouch. 2.16. Mix blood with anticoagulant in the collection bag and continue to mix at several intervals during collection and immediately after collection. If using an automated mixer, follow manufacturer's instructions. 2.17. Collect labeled volume of blood 500 mL \u00b110%. 2.18. When the desired amount of blood has been collected, seal the tubing or tighten the loose knot (white knot) prepared in Step 2.3. Make a second seal between the first seal or knot and the \"Y\". Various methods may be used to seal tubing. 2.19. Release pressure on the donor's arm and remove the needle into the needle safety device following the device instructions provided on the reverse side. Sever the donor tubing between the two seals previously made below the CLIKTIP and \"Y\". 2.19.1. CAUTION: Discard the Diversion Blood Sampling Arm and phlebotomy needle/donor tubing according to institutional standard operating procedures. 2.20. Seal and remove donor tubing from collection bag or strip donor tubing as follows: 2.20.1. To obtain a quality control prefiltration sample, strip blood from donor tubing into collection bag, mix well, and allow tubing to refill; repeat once. To prevent the blood from clotting in the tubing, work quickly as possible. Leave an adequate length of tubing containing the well-mixed anticoagulated whole blood attached to the collection bag. 2.20.2. Or, to maximize collection recovery, strip the tubing, mix well and seal tubing close to the collection bag without refilling. To prevent the blood from clotting in the tubing, work quickly as possible. Remove tubing from collection bag. 2.21. The blood filtration is executed according to the following operation. (see Fig.4 ) 2.21.1. NOTE: Red blood cells collected from certain donors may have extended filtration times and the potential for ineffective filtration and leukoreduction. 2.21.2. NOTE: Wait 30 minutes after collection before filtering. Filtration can be accomplished at room temperature for units maintained at room temperature and filtered within 8 hours of collection. Filtration can also be performed with units cooled towards 1-10\u00b0C within 8 hours of collection (e.g., during transport). If any unit has not completely filtered by 8 hours post collection, filtration must be completed at 1-6\u00b0C. Filtration can be unattended. 2.22. Mix the unfiltered whole blood unit by inverting the collection bag #1 (pre-filter bag) several times. 2.23. Hang the collection bag #1 and extend the filtration set to full length. Verify that the filter is vertical and ensure all tubing is freely suspended without kinks. 2.24. Break the CLIKTIP at the outlet of the collection bag #1. 2.24.1. The filter housing will begin to fill with blood and expand on the non-textured side. 2.24.2. Blood will flow across the filter pads and expand the textured side of the filter housing. 2.24.3. Air from the bag and filter will be forced into the primary bag #2 (post-filtration bag). 2.24.3.1. CAUTION: Do not squeeze or apply pressure on the filter while it is attached to the bag containing the filtered blood. 2.25. Filtration ends when the filter has emptied and the housing has collapsed onto the filter pads. 2.25.1. NOTE: Verify that collection bag #1 and pre-filtration tubing has emptied. 2.26. Gently squeeze the primary bag #2 to expel the air in the bag up the numbered segment tubing line and into the filter. To ensure ease of air removal ensure primary bag #2 is below the filter outlet. 2.27. Fill the numbered segment tubing with blood while expelling the air. 2.28. Clamp the blood filled tubing before blood enters the filter. 2.29. Seal the tubing as close as possible to the filter outlet and properly dispose of the filter and collection bag #1. 2.30. Strip the post filter tubing into the primary bag #2, mix well, and allow tubing to refill; repeat once. Make an appropriate number of segments of anticoagulated blood for testing by sealing on or near the X marks. Leave segments attached to the filtered whole blood unit. 2.31. The time between Whole Blood collection and component separation may vary depending on both the blood bag system and processing options selected. 2.31.1. NOTE: Production of Platelet concentrates is not intended with this product. 2.31.2. NOTE: Fresh Frozen Plasma should be separated from the Red Blood Cells and placed in a freezer at \u201318\u00b0C or colder within 8 hours of collection. 2.31.3. NOTE: OPTISOL should be added to the Red Blood Cells immediately after removal of the plasma. If plasma is not separated from the Red Blood Cells within 8 hours, OPTISOL may be added within 72 hours of collection if Whole Blood is refrigerated. 2.32. Follow your institution's standard component processing procedures to prepare components. 2.33. Centrifuge filtered whole blood unit to separate red cells from plasma. 2.34. Break the CLIKTIP of primary bag #2 and transfer leukocytes-reduced plasma into satellite bag #3. Clamp transfer tubing of satellite bag. 2.35. Break the CLIKTIP of OPTISOL Solution bag #4 and drain contents into primary bag #2 containing red blood cells. Seal tubing of primary bag in two places, and cut between seals and separate from satellite bag(s). 2.35.1. NOTE: Empty OPTISOL container may be used for further component preparation. 2.36. Invert the red blood cell \u2013 OPTISOL mixture several times to assure the final product is well suspended. 2.37. Store AS-5 Red Blood Cells, Leukocytes Reduced between 1-6\u00b0C for up to 42 days. 2.37.1. NOTE: Whole Blood or Red Blood Cells in CPD may be stored for up to 21 days at 1-6\u00b0C.

      "PROCEDURE FOR USE OF DonorCare\u00ae Needle Guard This device is for use by trained individuals. Intended Use The DonorCare\u00ae Needle Guard is incorporated onto the donor tubing to shield the needle immediately after withdrawal from the donor. Single Use Only. Preparation Move the DonorCare on the tubing ensuring that it slides easily and the arrow is pointing toward the needle hub. Ensure that the three lock points on the DonorCare are locked closed. Whole Blood Collection Perform the phlebotomy as per your institution's standard operating procedures. Slide the DonorCare over the needle hub so that it covers approximately one half to two thirds of the needle hub. Stabilize the DonorCare to the arm by placing a piece of tape over the front end so that the tape does not extend over the front of the DonorCare. Withdrawal of Needle Important The DonorCare must be held stationary while the needle is withdrawn into it. Caution The needle must be fully shielded by DonorCare to prevent accidental injury. Hold gauze over the venipuncture site with finger tips without exerting pressure. Hold the sides of the DonorCare near the front with the index finger and thumb of the same hand. With the other hand, hold the donor tubing close behind the DonorCare. Note: A hemostat may be placed on the tubing behind the DonorCare when the blood collection is complete. This will help to prevent blood drops from forming. Pull tubing smoothly and swiftly with one motion until the needle is locked in place inside the DonorCare. Confirm that the needle is locked by: Listening for two 'clicks' as the needle is drawn into DonorCare. If the clicks are not heard as the needle is drawn into the DonorCare, continue to pull firmly on the tubing to assure needle is fully withdrawn into DonorCare. Visually check that the needle is fully shielded by DonorCare before removing from the donor's arm. Remove the tape from the DonorCare and arm. Apply pressure to the gauze covering the venipuncture site. Warning Do not place fingers at the opening of DonorCare after removal from the donor's arm. Difficult Phlebotomy (Examples may include: Slow blood flow, deep or fine vein, steep angle) It may be necessary to delay placing the DonorCare over the needle hub until the end of the blood collection. In such situations: Leave the DonorCare on the tubing behind the needle hub. At the end of the blood collection carefully remove the tape from the needle hub and slide the DonorCare over the hub so that it covers approximately one half to two thirds of the needle hub. Withdraw the needle into the DonorCare as stated in steps 6. through 12. above. Rx ONLY DonorCare is manufactured by ITL Corporation, Melbourne, Australia.

      "BOXED WARNING WARNING Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . Because clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection therapy has been associated with severe colitis which may end fatally, it should be reserved for serious infections where less toxic antimicrobial agents are inappropriate, as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section. It should not be used in patients with nonbacterial infections such as most upper respiratory tract infections. C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Distribution Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate is converted to active clindamycin. By the end of short-term intravenous infusion, peak serum concentrations of active clindamycin are reached. After intramuscular injection of clindamycin phosphate, peak concentrations of active clindamycin are reached within 3 hours in adults and 1 hour in pediatric patients. Serum concentrations of clindamycin can be maintained above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentrations for most indicated organisms by administration of clindamycin phosphate every 8 to 12 hours in adults and every 6 to 8 hours in pediatric patients, or by continuous intravenous infusion. An equilibrium state is reached by the third dose. No significant concentrations of clindamycin are attained in the cerebrospinal fluid even in the presence of inflamed meninges. Metabolism In vitro studies in human liver and intestinal microsomes indicated that clindamycin is predominantly metabolized by Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), with minor contribution from CYP3A5, to form clindamycin sulfoxide and a minor metabolite, N-desmethylclindamycin. Excretion Biologically inactive clindamycin phosphate disappears from the serum with 6 minutes of the average elimination half-life; however, the average serum elimination half-life of active clindamycin is about 3 hours in adults and 2\u00bd hours in pediatric patients. Specific Populations Patients with Renal/Hepatic Impairment The elimination half-life of clindamycin is increased slightly in patients with markedly reduced renal or hepatic function. Hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are not effective in removing clindamycin from the serum. Dosage schedules do not need to be modified in patients with renal or hepatic disease. Geriatric Patients Pharmacokinetic studies in elderly volunteers (61 to 79 years) and younger adults (18 to 39 years) indicate that age alone does not alter clindamycin pharmacokinetics (clearance, elimination half-life, volume of distribution, and area under the serum concentration-time curve) after IV administration of clindamycin phosphate. After oral administration of clindamycin hydrochloride, the average elimination half-life is increased to approximately 4.0 hours (range 3.4 to 5.1 h) in the elderly, compared to 3.2 hours (range 2.1 to 4.2 h) in younger adults. The extent of absorption, however, is not different between age groups and no dosage alteration is necessary for the elderly with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function 1 . Pharmacokinetics in Pediatric Patients with PMA \u226432 weeks, or >32 to \u226440 weeks Systemic clearance (CL) in premature infants increases with increases in body weight (kg) and post-menstrual age (PMA). The dosing regimens for pediatric patients \u226432 weeks PMA (5 mg/kg) and >32 to \u2264 40 weeks PMA (7 mg/kg), both administered intravenously every 8 hours, achieve exposures comparable to therapeutic exposures in adults (weighing 70 kg) administered clindamycin 600 mg every 8 hours (Table 1).

Obese Pediatric Patients Aged 2 to Less than 18 Years and Obese Adults Aged 18 to 20 Years An analysis of pharmacokinetic data in obese pediatric patients aged 2 to less than 18 years and obese adults aged 18 to 20 years demonstrated that clindamycin clearance and volume of distribution, normalized by total body weight, are comparable regardless of obesity Microbiology Mechanism of Action Clindamycin inhibits bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the 23S RNA of the 50S subunit of the ribosome. Clindamycin is bacteriostatic. Resistance Resistance to clindamycin is most often caused by modification of specific bases of the 23S ribosomal RNA. Cross-resistance between clindamycin and lincomycin is complete. Because the binding sites for these antibacterial drugs overlap, cross-resistance is sometimes observed among lincosamides, macrolides and streptogramin B. Macrolide-inducible resistance to clindamycin occurs in some isolates of macrolide-resistant bacteria. Macrolide-resistant isolates of staphylococci and beta-hemolytic streptococci should be screened for induction of clindamycin resistance using the D-zone test. Antimicrobial Activity Clindamycin has been shown to be active against most of the isolates of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see INDICATIONS AND USAGE ]. Gram-positive Bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae (penicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus pyogenes Anaerobic Bacteria Clostridium perfringens Fusobacterium necrophorum Fusobacterium nucleatum Peptostreptococcus anaerobius Prevotella melaninogenica The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following bacteria exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for clindamycin against isolates of a similar genus or organism group. However, the efficacy of clindamycin in treating clinical infections due to these bacteria has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Gram-positive Bacteria Staphylococcus epidermidis (methicillin-susceptible strains) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus anginosus Streptococcus mitis Streptococcus oralis Anaerobic Bacteria Actinomyces israelii Clostridium clostridioforme Eggerthella lenta Finegoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros Prevotella bivia Prevotella intermedia Cutibacterium acnes Susceptibility Testing For specific information regarding susceptibility test interpretive criteria and associated test methods and quality control standards recognized by FDA for this drug, please see: https:// www.fda.gov/STIC.",

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection is also indicated in the treatment of serious infections due to susceptible strains of streptococci, pneumococci, and staphylococci. Its use should be reserved for penicillin-allergic patients or other patients for whom, in the judgment of the physician, a penicillin is inappropriate. Because of the risk of antibiotic-associated pseudomembranous colitis, as described in the BOXED WARNING , before selecting clindamycin the physician should consider the nature of the infection and the suitability of less toxic alternatives (e.g., erythromycin). Bacteriologic studies should be performed to determine the causative organisms and their susceptibility to clindamycin. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with antibiotic therapy. Clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection is indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated organisms in the conditions listed below: Lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, empyema, and lung abscess caused by anaerobes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, other streptococci (except E. faecalis ), and Staphylococcus aureus. Skin and skin structure infections caused by Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus , and anaerobes. Gynecological infections including endometritis, nongonococcal tubo-ovarian abscess, pelvic cellulitis, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection caused by susceptible anaerobes. Intra-abdominal infections including peritonitis and intra-abdominal abscess caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms. Septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus , streptococci (except Enterococcus faecalis ), and susceptible anaerobes. Bone and joint infections including acute hematogenous osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus and as adjunctive therapy in the surgical treatment of chronic bone and joint infections due to susceptible organisms. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection and other antibacterial drugs, clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy."

      "WARNINGS See BOXED WARNING . Clostridioides difficile- Associated Diarrhea Clostridioides difficile- associated diarrhea (CDAD) has been reported with use of nearly all antibacterial agents, including clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection, and may range in severity from mild diarrhea to fatal colitis. Treatment with antibacterial agents alters the normal flora of the colon leading to overgrowth of C. difficile . C. difficile produces toxins A and B which contribute to the development of CDAD. Hypertoxin producing strains of C. difficile cause increased morbidity and mortality, as these infections can be refractory to antimicrobial therapy and may require colectomy. CDAD must be considered in all patients who present with diarrhea following antibiotic use. Careful medical history is necessary since CDAD has been reported to occur over two months after the administration of antibacterial agents. If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile , and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated. Anaphylactic and Severe Hypersensitivity Reactions Anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic reactions have been reported ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . Severe hypersensitivity reactions, including severe skin reactions such as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), some with fatal outcome, have been reported ( see ADVERSE REACTIONS ) . In case of such an anaphylactic or severe hypersensitivity reaction, discontinue treatment permanently and institute appropriate therapy. A careful inquiry should be made concerning previous sensitivities to drugs and other allergens Nephrotoxicity Clindamycin is potentially nephrotoxic and cases with acute kidney injury have been reported. Consider monitoring of renal function particularly in patients with pre-existing renal dysfunction or those taking concomitant nephrotoxic drugs. In case of acute kidney injury, discontinue clindamycin when no other etiology is identified. Usage in Meningitis Since clindamycin does not diffuse adequately into the cerebrospinal fluid, the drug should not be used in the treatment of meningitis."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Review of experience to date suggests that a subgroup of older patients with associated severe illness may tolerate diarrhea less well. When clindamycin is indicated in these patients, they should be carefully monitored for change in bowel frequency. Clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection products should be prescribed with caution in individuals with a history of gastrointestinal disease, particularly colitis. Clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection should be prescribed with caution in atopic individuals. Certain infections may require incision and drainage or other indicated surgical procedures in addition to antibiotic therapy. The use of clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection may result in overgrowth of nonsusceptible organisms- particularly yeasts. Should superinfections occur, appropriate measures should be taken as indicated by the clinical situation. Clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection should not be injected intravenously undiluted as a bolus, but should be infused over at least 10 to 60 minutes as directed in the DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section. Clindamycin dosage modification may not be necessary in patients with renal disease. In patients with moderate to severe liver disease, prolongation of clindamycin half-life has been found. However, it was postulated from studies that when given every eight hours, accumulation should rarely occur. Therefore, dosage modification in patients with liver disease may not be necessary. However, periodic liver enzyme determinations should be made when treating patients with severe liver disease. Prescribing clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria. Information for Patients Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection or other antibacterial drugs in the future. Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible. Laboratory Tests During prolonged therapy periodic liver and kidney function tests and blood counts should be performed. Drug Interactions Clindamycin has been shown to have neuromuscular blocking properties that may enhance the action of other neuromuscular blocking agents. Therefore, it should be used with caution in patients receiving such agents. Clindamycin is metabolized predominantly by CYP3A4, and to a lesser extent by CYP3A5, to the major metabolite clindamycin sulfoxide and minor metabolite N-desmethylclindamycin. Therefore, inhibitors of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 may increase plasma concentrations of clindamycin and inducers of these isoenzymes may reduce plasma concentrations of clindamycin. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, monitor for adverse reactions. In the presence of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin, monitor for loss of effectiveness. In vitro studies indicate that clindamycin does not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 or CYP2D6 and only moderately inhibits CYP3A4. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long term studies in animals have not been performed with clindamycin to evaluate carcinogenic potential. Genotoxicity tests performed included a rat micronucleus test and an Ames Salmonella reversion test. Both tests were negative. Fertility studies in rats treated orally with up to 300 mg/kg/day (approximately 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 ) revealed no effects on fertility or mating ability. Pregnancy Teratogenic effects In clinical trials with pregnant women, the systemic administration of clindamycin during the second and third trimesters, has not been associated with an increased frequency of congenital abnormalities. Clindamycin should be used during the first trimester of pregnancy only if clearly needed. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of the human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Reproduction studies performed in rats and mice using oral doses of clindamycin up to 600 mg/kg/day (2.1 and 1.1 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) or subcutaneous doses of clindamycin up to 250 mg/kg/day (0.9 and 0.5 times the highest recommended adult human dose based on mg/m 2 , respectively) revealed no evidence of teratogenicity. Nursing Mothers Limited published data based on breast milk sampling reports that clindamycin appears in human breast milk in the range of less than 0.5 to 3.8 mcg/mL at dosages of 150 mg orally to 600 mg intravenously. Clindamycin has the potential to cause adverse effects on the breast-fed infant's gastrointestinal flora. If oral or intravenous clindamycin is required by a nursing mother, it is not a reason to discontinue breastfeeding, but an alternate drug may be preferred. Monitor the breast-fed infant for possible adverse effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea, candidiasis (thrush, diaper rash) or rarely, blood in the stool indicating possible antibiotic-associated colitis. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for clindamycin and any potential adverse effects on the breast-fed child from clindamycin or from the underlying maternal condition. Pediatric Use When clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection sterile solution is administered to the pediatric population (birth to 16 years) appropriate monitoring of organ system functions is desirable (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY and DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Geriatric Use Clinical studies of clindamycin did not include sufficient numbers of patients age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger patients. However, other reported clinical experience indicates that antibiotic-associated colitis and diarrhea (due to Clostridium difficile ) seen in association with most antibiotics occur more frequently in the elderly (>60 years) and may be more severe. These patients should be carefully monitored for the development of diarrhea. Pharmacokinetic studies with clindamycin have shown no clinically important differences between young and elderly subjects with normal hepatic function and normal (age-adjusted) renal function after oral or intravenous administration."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION If diarrhea occurs during therapy, this antibiotic should be discontinued (see WARNING box). Adults: Parenteral (IV Administration): Serious infections due to aerobic gram-positive cocci and the more susceptible anaerobes (NOT generally including Bacteroides fragilis , Peptococcus species and Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens ): 600 to 1200 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. More severe infections, particularly those due to proven or suspected Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus species, or Clostridium species other than Clostridium perfringens : 1200 to 2700 mg/day in 2, 3 or 4 equal doses. For more serious infections, these doses may have to be increased. In life-threatening situations due to either aerobes or anaerobes these doses may be increased. Doses of as much as 4800 mg daily have been given intravenously to adults. See Infusion Rates section below. Alternatively, drug may be administered in the form of a single rapid infusion of the first dose followed by continuous IV infusion as follows: Table 2: Serum Clindamycin Levels Maintained, Rapid Infusion Rate and Maintenance Infusion Rate To maintain serum clindamycin levels Rapid infusion rate Maintenance infusion rate Above 4 mcg/mL 10 mg/min for 30 min 0.75 mg/min Above 5 mcg/mL 15 mg/min for 30 min 1 mg/min Above 6 mcg/mL 20 mg/min for 30 min 1.25 mg/min Pediatric patients 1 month of age to 16 years: Parenteral (IV) Administration: 20 to 40 mg/kg/day in 3 or 4 equal doses. The higher doses would be used for more severe infections. As an alternative to dosing on a body weight basis, pediatric patients may be dosed on the basis of square meters body surface: 350 mg/m 2 /day for serious infections and 450 mg/m 2 /day for more severe infections. Parenteral therapy may be changed to oral clindamycin palmitate hydrochloride granules or clindamycin hydrochloride capsules when the condition warrants and at the discretion of the physician. In cases of \u03b2-hemolytic streptococcal infections, treatment should be continued for at least 10 days. Pediatric Patients less than 1 month: The recommended dosage is 15 to 20 mg/kg/day in 3 to 4 equal doses. See Table 3 regarding the dosing regimen for pediatric patients with post-menstrual age (PMA) less than or equal to 32 weeks, or greater than 32 weeks to less than or equal to 40 weeks. Table 3: Dosing Regimens for Pediatric Patients with PMA less than or equal to 32 weeks, or greater than 32 weeks to less than or equal to 40 weeks PMA (weeks) Dose (mg/kg) Dosing Interval (hours) Less than or equal to 32 5 8 Greater than or equal to 32 to less than or equal to 40 7 8 PMA: Post-Menstrual age Infusion Rates: Infusion rates for Clindamycin in 5% Dextrose Injection should not exceed 30 mg per minute. The usual infusion dilutions and rates are as follows: Dose Strength Time 300 mg/50 mL 6 mg/mL 10 min 600 mg/50 mL 12 mg/mL 20 min 900 mg/50 mL 18 mg/mL 30 min Administration of more than 1200 mg in a single 1-hour infusion is not recommended. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Compatibility Physical and biological compatibility studies monitored for 24 hours at room temperature have demonstrated no inactivation or incompatibility with the use of clindamycin in 5% dextrose injection sterile solution (clindamycin phosphate) in IV solutions containing sodium chloride, glucose, calcium or potassium, and solutions containing vitamin B complex in concentrations usually used clinically. No incompatibility has been demonstrated with the antibiotics cephalothin, kanamycin, gentamicin, penicillin or carbenicillin. The following drugs are physically incompatible with clindamycin phosphate: ampicillin sodium, phenytoin sodium, barbiturates, aminophylline, calcium gluconate, and magnesium sulfate. The compatibility and duration of stability of drug admixtures will vary depending on concentration and other conditions."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION Dopamine Hydrochloride in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic, prediluted solution of dopamine hydrochloride in 5% dextrose injection. It is administered by intravenous infusion. Each 100 mL contains dopamine hydrochloride 80 mg (0.8 mg/mL), 160 mg (1.6 mg/mL) or 320 mg (3.2 mg/mL) and dextrose, hydrous 5 g in water for injection, with sodium metabisulfite added 50 mg as a stabilizer; osmolar concentration, respectively 261, 269, or 286 mOsmol/liter (calc.), pH 3.8 (2.5 to 4.5). May contain hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. Dopamine administered intravenously is a myocardial inotropic agent, which also may increase mesenteric and renal blood flow plus urinary output. Dopamine Hydrochloride is chemically designated 3, 4-dihydroxyphenethylamine hydrochloride (C8H11NO2 \u2022 HCl), a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Dopamine (also referred to as 3-hydroxytyramine) is a naturally occurring endogenous catecholamine precursor of norepinephrine. Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose monohydrate (C6H12O6 \u2022 H2O), a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: Water for Injection, USP is chemically designated H2O. The flexible plastic container is fabricated from a specially formulated CR3 plastic material. Water can permeate from inside the container into the overwrap but not in amounts sufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts; however, biological testing was supportive of the safety of the plastic container materials. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00b0C/77\u00b0F during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. STRUCTURE 1 STRUCTURE 2"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Dopamine exhibits an inotropic action on the myocardium, resulting in increased cardiac output. It causes less increase in myocardial oxygen consumption than isoproterenol and the effect of dopamine usually is not associated with tachyarrhythmia. Reported clinical studies have revealed that the drug usually increases systolic and pulse pressure without any or only a minor elevating effect on diastolic pressure. Total peripheral resistance at low and intermediate doses is usually unchanged. Blood flow to peripheral vascular beds may decrease while mesenteric blood flow is increased. The drug also has been reported to produce dilation of the renal vasculature which is accompanied by increases in glomerular filtration rate, renal blood flow and sodium excretion. Increased urinary output produced by dopamine is usually not associated with decreased urine osmolality. Solutions containing carbohydrate in the form of dextrose restore blood glucose levels and provide calories. Carbohydrate in the form of dextrose may aid in minimizing liver glycogen depletion and exerts a protein-sparing action. Dextrose injected parenterally undergoes oxidation to carbon dioxide and water. Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss due to perspiration and urine production). Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium. The reported clearance rate of dopamine in critically ill infants and children has ranged from 46 to 168 mL/kg/min, with the higher values seen in the younger patients. The apparent volume of distribution in neonates is reported as 0.6 to 4 L/kg, leading to an elimination half-life of 5 to 11 minutes."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS & USAGE Dopamine Hydrochloride in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is indicated for the correction of hemodynamic imbalances present in shock due to myocardial infarction, trauma, endotoxic septicemia, open heart surgery, renal failure and chronic cardiac decompensation as in refractory congestive failure. When indicated, restoration of circulatory volume should be instituted or completed with a suitable plasma expander or whole blood, prior to administration of dopamine hydrochloride. Patients most likely to respond to dopamine are those whose physiological parameters (such as urine flow, myocardial function and blood pressure) have not undergone extreme deterioration. Reports indicate that the shorter the time between onset of signs and symptoms and initiation of therapy with volume restoration and dopamine, the better the prognosis. Poor Perfusion of Vital Organs: Although urine flow is apparently one of the better diagnostic signs for monitoring vital organ perfusion, the physician also should observe the patient for signs of reversal of mental confusion or coma. Loss of pallor, increase in toe temperature or adequacy of nail bed capillary filling also may be observed as indices of adequate dosage. Reported studies indicate that when dopamine is administered before urine flow has decreased to approximately 0.3 mL/minute prognosis is more favorable. However, it has been observed that in some oliguric or anuric patients, administration of the drug has produced an increase in urine flow which may reach normal levels. The drug also may increase urine flow in patients whose output is within normal limits and thus may help in reducing the degree of pre-existing fluid accumulation. Conversely, at higher than optimal doses for a given patient, urinary flow may decrease, requiring a reduction of dosage. Concomitant administration of dopamine and diuretic agents may produce an additive or potentiating effect. Low Cardiac Output: Dopamine's direct inotropic effect on the myocardium which increases cardiac output at low or moderate doses is related to a favorable prognosis. Increased output has been associated with unchanged or decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The association of static or decreased SVR with low or moderate increases in cardiac output is regarded as a reflection of differential effects on specific vascular beds, with increased resistance in peripheral beds (e.g., femoral), and concurrent decreases in mesenteric and renal vascular beds. Redistribution of blood flow parallels these changes so that an increase in cardiac output is accompanied by an increase in mesenteric and renal blood flow. In many instances the renal fraction of the total cardiac output has been found to increase. Increase in cardiac output produced by dopamine is not associated with substantial decreases in systemic vascular resistance as may occur with isoproterenol. Hypotension: Low to moderate doses of dopamine, which have little effect on SVR, can be used to manage hypotension due to inadequate cardiac output. At high therapeutic doses, dopamine's \u03b1-adrenergic action becomes more prominent and thus may correct hypotension due to diminished SVR. As in other circulatory decompensation states, prognosis is better in patients whose blood pressure and urine flow have not undergone extreme deterioration. Therefore, it is suggested the physician administer dopamine as soon as a definite trend toward decreased systolic and diastolic pressure becomes apparent."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS Dopamine hydrochloride should not be used in patients with pheochromocytoma. Dopamine should not be administered in the presence of uncorrected tachyarrhythmias or ventricular fibrillation."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Do NOT add any alkalinizing substance, since dopamine is inactivated in alkaline solution. Patients who have been treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors prior to administration of dopamine should receive substantially reduced dosage of the latter. See PRECAUTIONS , Drug Interactions, below. Additive medications should not be delivered via this solution. Dopamine Hydrochloride in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP contains sodium metabisulfite, a sulfite that may cause allergic-type reactions including anaphylactic symptoms and life-threatening or less severe asthmatic episodes in certain susceptible people. The overall prevalence of sulfite sensitivity in the general population is unknown and probably low. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic than in nonasthmatic people."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General: Solutions containing dextrose should be used with caution in patients with known subclinical or overt diabetes mellitus. Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Excess administration of potassium-free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia. The intravenous administration of these solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. Careful Monitoring Required: Close monitoring of the following indices \u2500 urine flow, cardiac output and blood pressure \u2500 during dopamine infusion is necessary as in the case of any adrenergic agent. Hypoxia, Hypercapnia, Acidosis: These conditions, which may also reduce the effectiveness and/or increase the incidence of adverse effects of dopamine, must be identified and corrected prior to, or concurrently with, administration of dopamine HCl. Ventricular Arrhythmias: If an increased number of ectopic beats are observed the dose should be reduced if possible. Hypotension: At lower infusion rates, if hypotension occurs, the infusion rate should be rapidly increased until adequate blood pressure is obtained. If hypotension persists, dopamine HCl should be discontinued and a more potent vasoconstrictor agent such as norepinephrine should be administered. Occlusive Vascular Disease: Patients with a history of occlusive vascular disease (e.g., arteriosclerosis, arterial embolism, Raynaud's disease, cold injury such as frostbite, diabetic endarteritis, and Buerger's disease) should be closely monitored for any changes in color or temperature of the skin of the extremities. If a change in skin color or temperature occurs and is thought to be the result of compromised circulation to the extremities, the benefits of continued dopamine infusion should be weighed against the risk of possible necrosis. These changes may be reversed by decreasing the rate or discontinuing the infusion entirely. Extravasation: Dopamine Hydrochloride in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP should be infused into a large vein whenever possible to prevent the possibility of infiltration of perivascular tissue adjacent to the infusion site. Extravasation may cause necrosis and sloughing of surrounding tissue. Large veins of the antecubital fossa are preferred to veins of the dorsum of the hand or ankle. Administration into an umbilical arterial catheter is not recommended. Less suitable infusion sites should be used only when larger veins are unavailable and the patient's condition requires immediate attention. The physician should switch to a more suitable site as soon as possible and the infusion site in use should be continuously monitored for free flow. Laboratory Tests: Infusion of dopamine suppresses pituitary secretion of thyroid\u2013stimulating hormone, growth hormone, and prolactin. Weaning: When discontinuing the infusion, it may be necessary to gradually decrease the dose of dopamine HCl while expanding blood volume with intravenous fluids. Sudden cessation may result in marked hypotension. Drug Interactions: Cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics increase cardiac autonomic irritability and may sensitize the myocardium to the action of certain intravenously administered catecholamines, such as dopamine. This interaction appears to be related both to pressor activity and to the \u03b2-adrenergic stimulating properties of these catecholamines, and may produce ventricular arrhythmias and hypertension. Therefore, EXTREME CAUTION should be exercised when administering dopamine HCl to patients receiving cyclopropane or halogenated hydrocarbon anesthetics. Results of studies in animals indicate that dopamine-induced ventricular arrhythmias during anesthesia can be reversed by propranolol. Because dopamine is metabolized by monoamine oxidase (MAO), inhibition of this enzyme prolongs and potentiates the effect of dopamine. Patients who have been treated with MAO inhibitors within two to three weeks prior to the administration of dopamine should receive initial doses of dopamine hydrochloride no greater than one-tenth (1/10) of the usual dose. Concurrent administration of low-dose dopamine HCl and diuretic agents may produce an additive or potentiating effect on urine flow. Tricyclic antidepressants may potentiate the cardiovascular effects of adrenergic agents. Cardiac effects of dopamine are antagonized by \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents, such as propranolol and metoprolol. The peripheral vasoconstriction caused by high doses of dopamine HCl is antagonized by \u03b1-adrenergic blocking agents. Dopamine-induced renal and mesenteric vasodilation is not antagonized by either \u03b1- or \u03b2-adrenergic blocking agents. Butyrophenones (such as haloperidol) and phenothiazines can suppress the dopaminergic renal and mesenteric vasodilation induced with low-dose dopamine infusion. The concomitant use of vasopressors, vasoconstricting agents (such as ergonovine) and some oxytocic drugs may result in severe hypertension. Administration of phenytoin to patients receiving dopamine HCl has been reported to lead to hypotension and bradycardia. It is suggested that in patients receiving dopamine HCl, alternatives to phenytoin should be considered if anticonvulsant therapy is needed. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: Long term animal studies have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of dopamine HCl. Dopamine HCl at doses approaching maximal solubility showed no clear genotoxic potential in the Ames test. Although there was a reproducible dose-dependent increase in the number of revertant colonies with strains TA100 and TA98, both with and without metabolic activation, the small increase was considered inconclusive evidence of mutagenicity. In the L5178Y TK+/- mouse lymphoma assay, dopamine HCl at the highest concentrations used of 750 \u03bcg/mL without metabolic activation, and 3000 \u03bcg/mL with activation, was toxic and associated with increases in mutant frequencies when compared to untreated and solvent controls; at the lower concentrations no increases over controls were noted. No clear evidence of clastogenic potential was reported in the in vivo mouse or male rat bone marrow micronucleus test when the animals were treated intravenously with up to 224 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of dopamine HCl, respectively. Pregnancy: Teratogenic Effects: Teratogenicity studies in rats and rabbits at dopamine HCl dosages up to 6 mg/kg/day intravenously during organogenesis produced no detectable teratogenic or embryotoxic effects, although maternal toxicity consisting of mortalities, decreased body weight gain, and pharmacotoxic signs were observed in rats. In a published study, dopamine HCl administered at 10 mg/kg subcutaneously for 30 days, markedly prolonged metestrus and increased mean pituitary and ovary weights in female rats. Similar administration to pregnant rats throughout gestation or for 5 days starting on gestation day 10 or 15 resulted in decreased body weight gains, increased mortalities and slight increases in cataract formation among the offspring. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women, and it is not known if dopamine HCl crosses the placental barrier. Dopamine HCl should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Labor and Delivery: In obstetrics, if vasopressor drugs are used to correct hypotension or are added to a local anesthetic solution the interaction with some oxytocic drugs may cause severe hypertension. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when dopamine HCl is administered to a nursing mother. Pediatric Use: Dopamine infusions have been used in patients of every age from birth onwards. There are scattered reports of infusion rates in neonates up to 125 mcg/kg/min, but most reports in pediatric patients describe dosing that is similar (on a mcg/kg/min basis) to that used in adults. Except for vasoconstrictive effects caused by inadvertent infusion of dopamine into the umbilical artery, adverse effects unique to the pediatric population have not been identified, nor have adverse effects identified in adults been found to be more common in pediatric patients. Geriatric Use: Clinical studies of dopamine injection did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the frequency of decreased hepatic, renal or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE In the case of accidental overdosage, as evidenced by excessive blood pressure elevation, reduce rate of infusion, or temporarily discontinue administration of the drug until patient's condition stabilizes. Since dopamine's duration of action is quite short, no additional remedial measures are usually necessary. If these measures fail to stabilize the patient's condition, consider using an alpha-adrenergic blocking agent (e.g., phentolamine)."
    ],
    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE & ADMINISTRATION Do NOT administer if solution is darker than slightly yellow or discolored in any other way. Do NOT administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. Dextrose solutions without electrolytes should not be administered simultaneously with blood through the same infusion set because of the possibility that pseudoagglutination of red cells may occur. Do NOT add sodium bicarbonate or other alkalinizing substance, since dopamine is inactivated in alkaline solution. Dopamine Hydrochloride in 5% Dextrose Injection should be infused into a large vein whenever possible to prevent the infiltration of perivascular tissue adjacent to the infusion site. Extravasation may cause necrosis and sloughing of the surrounding tissue. Large veins of the antecubital fossa are preferred to veins of the dorsum of the hand or ankle. Less suitable infusion sites should be used only when larger veins are unavailable and the patient's condition requires immediate attention. The physician should switch to a more suitable site as soon as possible and the infusion site in use should be continuously monitored for free flow. The less concentrated 800 mcg/mL solution may be preferred when fluid expansion is not a problem. The more concentrated 1600 mcg/mL or 3200 mcg/mL solutions, may be preferred in patients with fluid retention or when a slower rate of infusion is desired. Rate of Administration: Administration into an umbilical artery catheter is not recommended. Dopamine in 5% Dextrose Injection should not be infused through ordinary intravenous apparatus, regulated only by gravity and mechanical clamps. Only an infusion pump, preferably a volumetric pump, should be used. Each patient must be individually titrated to the desired hemodynamic or renal response to dopamine. In titrating to the desired increase in systolic blood pressure, the optimum dosage rate for renal response may be exceeded, thus necessitating a reduction in rate after the hemodynamic condition is stabilized. If a disproportionate rise in diastolic pressure (i.e., a marked decrease in pulse pressure) is observed in patients receiving dopamine, the infusion rate should be decreased and the patient observed carefully for further evidence of predominant vasoconstrictor activity, unless such an effect is desired. Administration rates greater than 50 mcg/kg/min have safely been used in adults in advanced circulatory decompensation states. If unnecessary fluid expansion is of concern, adjustment of drug concentration may be preferred over increasing the flow rate of a less concentrated dilution. When discontinuing the infusion, it may be necessary to gradually decrease the dose of dopamine HCl while expanding the blood volume with intravenous fluids to prevent the development of marked hypotension. Suggested Regimen: 1. When appropriate, increase blood volume with whole blood or plasma until central venous pressure is 10 to 15 cm H2O or pulmonary wedge pressure is 14 to 18 mm Hg. 2. Begin infusion of dopamine hydrochloride solution at doses of 2 to 5 mcg/kg/min in adult or pediatric patients who are likely to respond to modest increments of heart force and renal perfusion. In more seriously ill patients, begin infusion of dopamine hydrochloride at doses of 5 mcg/kg/min and increase gradually, using 5 to 10 mcg/kg/min increments, up to a rate of 20 to 50 mcg/kg/min as needed. If doses in excess of 50 mcg/kg/min are required, check urine output frequently. Should urinary flow begin to decrease in the absence of hypotension, reduction of dopamine dosage should be considered. More than 50% of adult patients have been satisfactorily maintained on doses less than 20 mcg/kg/min. In patients who do not respond to these doses with adequate arterial pressures or urine flow, additional increments of dopamine may be given in an effort to produce an appropriate arterial pressure and central perfusion. 3. Treatment of all patients requires constant evaluation of therapy in terms of blood volume, augmentation of cardiac contractility, urine flow, cardiac output, blood pressure, and distribution of peripheral perfusion. Dosage of dopamine should be adjusted according to the patient's response. Diminution of established urine flow rate, increasing tachycardia or development of new dysrhythmias are reasons to consider decreasing or temporarily suspending the dosage. 4. As with all potent intravenously administered drugs, care should be taken to control the rate of infusion so as to avoid inadvertent administration of a bolus of the drug. 800 mcg/mL Dosing Chart for Dopamine (mL/hr) Infusion Rate 1600 mcg/mL Dosing Chart for Dopamine (mL/hr) Infusion Rate 3200 mcg/mL Dosing Chart for Dopamine (mL/hr) Infusion Rate Parenteral drug products should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

      "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: Reduce resistance to new infections Exacerbate existing infections Increase the risk of disseminated infections Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If PredniSONE Tablets USP is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are nonimmune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles: If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with PredniSONE Tablets USP. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid PredniSONE Tablets USP use in the presence of such infections unless PredniSONE Tablets USP is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating PredniSONE Tablets USP in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, in patients with cerebral malaria. Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Information for Patients Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice."

Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur."

      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT \u00ae (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing\u2019s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

      "DESCRIPTION Milrinone lactate is a member of a new class of bipyridine inotropic/vasodilator agents with phosphodiesterase inhibitor activity, distinct from digitalis glycosides or catecholamines. Milrinone lactate is designated chemically as 1,6- dihydro-2-methyl-6-oxo-[3,4\u2019-bipyridine]-5-carbonitrile lactate and has the following structure: Milrinone, USP is a white to tan crystalline compound with a molecular weight of 211.2 and a molecular formula of C 12 H 9 N 3 O. It is freely soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide; very slightly soluble in methanol, practically insoluble in water and in chloroform. As the lactate salt, it is stable and colorless to pale yellow in solution. Milrinone is available as sterile aqueous solutions of the lactate salt of milrinone for infusion intravenously. The Flexible containers provide two ready-to-use dilutions of milrinone in volumes of 100 mL and 200 mL of 5% Dextrose Injection. Each mL contains milrinone lactate equivalent to 200 mcg milrinone. The nominal concentration of lactic acid is 0.282 mg/mL. Each mL also contains 54.3 mg dextrose, hydrous, USP. The pH is adjusted to between 3.2 and 4.0 with lactic acid and/or sodium hydroxide. The flexible plastic container is comprised of polypropylene with a foil overwrap. Water can permeate the plastic into the overwrap, but the amount is insufficient to significantly affect the premixed solution. milrinone-structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Milrinone is a positive inotrope and vasodilator, with little chronotropic activity different in structure and mode of action from either the digitalis glycosides or catecholamines. Milrinone at relevant inotropic and vasorelaxant concentrations, is a selective inhibitor of peak III cAMP phosphodiesterase isozyme in cardiac and vascular muscle. This inhibitory action is consistent with cAMP mediated increases in intracellular ionized calcium and contractile force in cardiac muscle, as well as with cAMP dependent contractile protein phosphorylation and relaxation in vascular muscle. Additional experimental evidence also indicates that Milrinone is not a beta-adrenergic agonist nor does it inhibit sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase activity as do the digitalis glycosides. Clinical studies in patients with congestive heart failure have shown that Milrinone produces dose-related and plasma drug concentration-related increases in the maximum rate of increase of left ventricular pressure. Studies in normal subjects have shown that milrinone produces increases in the slope of the left ventricular pressure-dimension relationship, indicating a direct inotropic effect of the drug. Milrinone also produces dose-related and plasma concentration-related increases in forearm blood flow in patients with congestive heart failure, indicating a direct arterial vasodilator activity of the drug. Both the inotropic and vasodilatory effects have been observed over the therapeutic range of plasma milrinone concentrations of 100 ng/mL to 300 ng/mL. In addition to increasing myocardial contractility, milrinone improves diastolic function as evidenced by improvements in left ventricular diastolic relaxation. The acute administration of intravenous milrinone has also been evaluated in clinical trials in excess of 1600 patients, with chronic heart failure, heart failure associated with cardiac surgery, and heart failure associated with myocardial infarction. The total number of deaths, either on therapy or shortly thereafter (24 hours) was 15, less than 0.9%, few of which were thought to be drug-related."
    ],
    "spl_unclassified_section": [
      "PHARMACOKINETICS Following intravenous injections of 12.5 mcg/kg to 125 mcg/kg to congestive heart failure patients, milrinone had a volume of distribution of 0.38 liters/kg, a mean terminal elimination half-life of 2.3 hours, and a clearance of 0.13 liters/kg/hr. Following intravenous infusions of 0.20 mcg/kg/min to 0.70 mcg/kg/min to congestive heart failure patients, the drug had a volume of distribution of about 0.45 liters/kg, a mean terminal elimination half-life of 2.4 hours, and a clearance of 0.14 liters/kg/hr. These pharmacokinetic parameters were not dose-dependent, and the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve following injections was significantly dose-dependent. Milrinone has been shown (by equilibrium dialysis) to be approximately 70% bound to human plasma protein. The primary route of excretion of milrinone in man is via the urine. The major urinary excretions of orally administered milrinone in man are milrinone (83%) and its O-glucuronide metabolite (12%). Elimination in normal subjects via the urine is rapid, with approximately 60% recovered within the first two hours following dosing and approximately 90% recovered within the first eight hours following dosing. The mean renal clearance of milrinone is approximately 0.3 liters/min, indicative of active secretion.",
      "PHARMACODYNAMICS In patients with heart failure due to depressed myocardial function, milrinone produced a prompt dose and plasma concentration related increase in cardiac output and decreases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and vascular resistance, which were accompanied by mild-to-moderate increases in heart rate. Additionally, there is no increased effect on myocardial oxygen consumption. In uncontrolled studies, hemodynamic improvement during intravenous therapy with milrinone was accompanied by clinical symptomatic improvement, but the ability of milrinone to relieve symptoms has not been evaluated in controlled clinical trials. The great majority of patients experience improvements in hemodynamic function within 5 to 15 minutes of the initiation of therapy. In studies in congestive heart failure patients, milrinone when administered as a loading injection followed by a maintenance infusion produced significant mean initial increases in cardiac index of 25 percent, 38 percent, and 42 percent at dose regimens of 37.5 mcg/kg/0.375 mcg/kg/ min, 50 mcg/kg/0.50 mcg/kg/min, and 75 mcg/kg/0.75 mcg/kg/min, respectively. Over the same range of loading injections and maintenance infusions, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure significantly decreased by 20 percent, 23 percent, and 36 percent, respectively, while systemic vascular resistance significantly decreased by 17 percent, 21 percent, and 37 percent. Mean arterial pressure fell by up to 5 percent at the two lower dose regimens, but by 17 percent at the highest dose. Patients evaluated for 48 hours maintained improvements in hemodynamic function, with no evidence of diminished response (tachyphylaxis). A smaller number of patients have received infusions of milrinone for periods up to 72 hours without evidence of tachyphylaxis. The duration of therapy should depend upon patient responsiveness. Milrinone has a favorable inotropic effect in fully digitalized patients without causing signs of glycoside toxicity. Theoretically, in cases of atrial flutter/fibrillation, it is possible that milrinone may increase ventricular response rate because of its slight enhancement of AV node conduction. In these cases, digitalis should be considered prior to the institution of therapy with milrinone. Improvement in left ventricular function in patients with ischemic heart disease has been observed. The improvement has occurred without inducing symptoms or electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia. The steady-state plasma milrinone concentrations after approximately 6 to 12 hours of unchanging maintenance infusion of 0.50 mcg/kg/min are approximately 200 ng/mL. Near maximum favorable effects of milrinone on cardiac output and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure are seen at plasma milrinone concentrations in the 150 ng/mL to 250 ng/mL range."

      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE Milrinone is indicated for the short-term intravenous treatment of patients with acute decompensated heart failure. Patients receiving milrinone should be observed closely with appropriate electrocardiographic equipment. The facility for immediate treatment of potential cardiac events, which may include life threatening ventricular arrhythmias, must be available. The majority of experience with intravenous milrinone has been in patients receiving digoxin and diuretics. There is no experience in controlled trials with infusions of milrinone for periods exceeding 48 hours."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Whether given orally or by continuous or intermittent intravenous infusion, milrinone has not been shown to be safe or effective in the longer (greater than 48 hours) treatment of patients with heart failure. In a multicenter trial of 1088 patients with Class III and IV heart failure, long-term oral treatment with milrinone was associated with no improvement in symptoms and an increased risk of hospitalization and death. In this study, patients with Class IV symptoms appeared to be at particular risk of life-threatening cardiovascular reactions. There is no evidence that milrinone given by long-term continuous or intermittent infusion does not carry a similar risk. The use of milrinone both intravenously and orally has been associated with increased frequency of ventricular arrhythmias, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Long-term oral use has been associated with an increased risk of sudden death. Hence, patients receiving milrinone should be observed closely with the use of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring to allow the prompt detection and management of ventricular arrhythmias."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Milrinone should not be used in patients with severe obstructive aortic or pulmonic valvular disease in lieu of surgical relief of the obstruction. Like other inotropic agents, it may aggravate outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias have been observed in the high-risk population treated. In some patients, injections of milrinone and oral milrinone have been shown to increase ventricular ectopy, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The potential for arrhythmia, present in congestive heart failure itself, may be increased by many drugs or combinations of drugs. Patients receiving milrinone should be closely monitored during infusion. Milrinone produces a slight shortening of AV node conduction time, indicating a potential for an increased ventricular response rate in patients with atrial flutter/fibrillation which is not controlled with digitalis therapy. During therapy with milrinone, blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored and the rate of infusion slowed or stopped in patients showing excessive decreases in blood pressure. If prior vigorous diuretic therapy is suspected to have caused significant decreases in cardiac filling pressure, milrinone should be cautiously administered with monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and clinical symptomatology. There is no experience in controlled trials with infusions of milrinone for periods exceeding 48 hours. Cases of infusion site reaction have been reported with intravenous milrinone therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Consequently, careful monitoring of the infusion site should be maintained to avoid possible extravasation. Use in Acute Myocardial Infarction No clinical studies have been conducted in patients in the acute phase of post myocardial infarction. Until further clinical experience with this class of drugs is gained, milrinone is not recommended in these patients. Laboratory Tests Fluid and electrolytes: Fluid and electrolyte changes and renal function should be carefully monitored during therapy with milrinone. Improvement in cardiac output with resultant diuresis may necessitate a reduction in the dose of diuretic. Potassium loss due to excessive diuresis may predispose digitalized patients to arrhythmias. Therefore, hypokalemia should be corrected by potassium supplementation in advance of or during use of milrinone. Drug Interactions No untoward clinical manifestations have been observed in limited experience with patients in whom milrinone was used concurrently with the following drugs: digitalis glycosides; lidocaine, quinidine; hydralazine, prazosin; isosorbide dinitrate, nitroglycerin; chlorthalidone, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone; captopril; heparin, warfarin, diazepam, insulin; and potassium supplements. Chemical Interactions There is an immediate chemical interaction which is evidenced by the formation of a precipitate when furosemide is injected into an intravenous line of an infusion of milrinone. Therefore, furosemide should not be administered in intravenous lines containing milrinone. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Twenty-four months of oral administration of milrinone to mice at doses up to 40 mg/kg/day (about 50 times the human oral therapeutic dose in a 50 kg patient) was unassociated with evidence of carcinogenic potential. Neither was there evidence of carcinogenic potential when milrinone was orally administered to rats at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day (about 6 times the human oral therapeutic dose) for twenty-four months or at 25 mg/ kg/day (about 30 times the human oral therapeutic dose) for up to 18 months in males and 20 months in females. Whereas the Chinese Hamster Ovary Chromosome Aberration Assay was positive in the presence of a metabolic activation system, results from the Ames Test, the Mouse Lymphoma Assay, the Micronucleus Test, and the in vivo Rat Bone Marrow Metaphase Analysis indicated an absence of mutagenic potential. In reproductive performance studies in rats, milrinone had no effect on male or female fertility at oral doses up to 32 mg/kg/day. Animal Toxicity Oral and intravenous administration of toxic dosages of milrinone to rats and dogs resulted in myocardial degeneration/fibrosis and endocardial hemorrhage, principally affecting the left ventricular papillary muscles. Coronary vascular lesions characterized by periarterial edema and inflammation have been observed in dogs only. The myocardial/endocardial changes are similar to those produced by beta-adrenergic receptor agonists such as isoproterenol, while the vascular changes are similar to those produced by minoxidil and hydralazine. Doses within the recommended clinical dose range (up to 1.13 mg/kg/day) for congestive heart failure patients have not produced significant adverse effects in animals. Pregnancy Oral administration of milrinone to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis produced no evidence of teratogenicity at dose levels up to 40 mg/kg/day and 12 mg/kg/day, respectively. Milrinone did not appear to be teratogenic when administered intravenously to pregnant rats at doses up to 3 mg/kg/day (about 2.5 times the maximum recommended clinical intravenous dose) or pregnant rabbits at doses up to 12 mg/kg/ day, although an increased resorption rate was apparent at both 8 mg/kg/day and 12 mg/kg/day (intravenous) in the latter species. There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Milrinone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Nursing Mothers Caution should be exercised when milrinone is administered to nursing women, since it is not known whether it is excreted in human milk. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Use in Elderly Patients There are no special dosage recommendations for the elderly patient. Ninety percent of all patients administered milrinone in clinical studies were within the age range of 45 to 70 years, with a mean age of 61 years. Patients in all age groups demonstrated clinically and statistically significant responses. No age-related effects on the incidence of adverse reactions have been observed. Controlled pharmacokinetic studies have not disclosed any age-related effects on the distribution and elimination of milrinone."

    "general_precautions": [
      "General Milrinone should not be used in patients with severe obstructive aortic or pulmonic valvular disease in lieu of surgical relief of the obstruction. Like other inotropic agents, it may aggravate outflow tract obstruction in hypertrophic subaortic stenosis. Supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias have been observed in the high-risk population treated. In some patients, injections of milrinone and oral milrinone have been shown to increase ventricular ectopy, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. The potential for arrhythmia, present in congestive heart failure itself, may be increased by many drugs or combinations of drugs. Patients receiving milrinone should be closely monitored during infusion. Milrinone produces a slight shortening of AV node conduction time, indicating a potential for an increased ventricular response rate in patients with atrial flutter/fibrillation which is not controlled with digitalis therapy. During therapy with milrinone, blood pressure and heart rate should be monitored and the rate of infusion slowed or stopped in patients showing excessive decreases in blood pressure. If prior vigorous diuretic therapy is suspected to have caused significant decreases in cardiac filling pressure, milrinone should be cautiously administered with monitoring of blood pressure, heart rate, and clinical symptomatology. There is no experience in controlled trials with infusions of milrinone for periods exceeding 48 hours. Cases of infusion site reaction have been reported with intravenous milrinone therapy (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Consequently, careful monitoring of the infusion site should be maintained to avoid possible extravasation."

    "laboratory_tests": [
      "Laboratory Tests Fluid and electrolytes: Fluid and electrolyte changes and renal function should be carefully monitored during therapy with milrinone. Improvement in cardiac output with resultant diuresis may necessitate a reduction in the dose of diuretic. Potassium loss due to excessive diuresis may predispose digitalized patients to arrhythmias. Therefore, hypokalemia should be corrected by potassium supplementation in advance of or during use of milrinone."

    "drug_interactions": [
      "Drug Interactions No untoward clinical manifestations have been observed in limited experience with patients in whom milrinone was used concurrently with the following drugs: digitalis glycosides; lidocaine, quinidine; hydralazine, prazosin; isosorbide dinitrate, nitroglycerin; chlorthalidone, furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide, spironolactone; captopril; heparin, warfarin, diazepam, insulin; and potassium supplements."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Cardiovascular Effects In patients receiving milrinone in Phase II and III clinical trials, ventricular arrhythmias were reported in 12.1%: Ventricular ectopic activity, 8.5%; nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, 2.8%; sustained ventricular tachycardia, 1% and ventricular fibrillation, 0.2% (2 patients experienced more than one type of arrhythmia). Holter recordings demonstrated that in some patients injection of milrinone increased ventricular ectopy, including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. Life-threatening arrhythmias were infrequent and when present have been associated with certain underlying factors such as preexisting arrhythmias, metabolic abnormalities (e.g. hypokalemia), abnormal digoxin levels and catheter insertion. Milrinone was not shown to be arrhythmogenic in an electrophysiology study. Supraventricular arrhythmias were reported in 3.8% of the patients receiving milrinone. The incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias has not been related to the dose or plasma milrinone concentration. Other cardiovascular adverse reactions include hypotension, 2.9% and angina/chest pain, 1.2%. In the post marketing experience, there have been rare cases of \u201ctorsades de pointes\u201d reported. CNS Effects Headaches, usually mild to moderate in severity, have been reported in 2.9% of patients receiving milrinone. Other Effects Other adverse reactions reported, but not definitely related to the administration of milrinone include hypokalemia, 0.6%; tremor, 0.4%; and thrombocytopenia, 0.4%. Post-Marketing Adverse Event Reports In addition to adverse events reported from clinical trials, the following events have been reported from worldwide post-marketing experience with Milrinone: Isolated spontaneous reports of bronchospasm and anaphylactic shock. Liver function test abnormalities and skin reactions such as rash. Administration site conditions: Infusion site reaction."

Maintenance Dose Infusion Rate Total Daily Dose (24 Hours) Minimum Standard Maximum 0.375 mcg/kg/min 0.50 mcg/kg/min 0.75 mcg/kg/min 0.59 mg/kg 0.77 mg/kg 1.13 mg/kg Administer as a continuous intravenous infusion The infusion rate should be adjusted according to hemodynamic and clinical response. Patients should be closely monitored. In controlled clinical studies, most patients showed an improvement in hemodynamic status as evidenced by increases in cardiac output and reductions in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. Note: See \u201cDosage Adjustment in Renally Impaired Patients.\u201d Dosage may be titrated to the maximum hemodynamic effect and should not exceed 1.13 mg/kg/day. Duration of therapy should depend upon patient responsiveness. The maintenance dose in mL/hr by patient body weight (kg) may be determined by reference to the following table. Milrinone Infusion Rate (mL/hr) Using 200 mcg/mL Concentration Maintenance Dose (mcg/kg/min) Patient Body Weight (kg) 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 0.375 3.4 4.5 5.6 6.8 7.9 9.0 10.1 11.3 12.4 13.5 0.400 3.6 4.8 6.0 7.2 8.4 9.6 10.8 12.0 13.2 14.4 0.500 4.5 6.0 7.5 9.0 10.5 12.0 13.5 15.0 16.5 18.0 0.600 5.4 7.2 9.0 10.8 12.6 14.4 16.2 18.0 19.8 21.6 0.700 6.3 8.4 10.5 12.6 14.7 16.8 18.9 21.0 23.1 25.2 0.750 6.8 9.0 11.3 13.5 15.8 18.0 20.3 22.5 24.8 27.0 Dosage Adjustment in Renally Impaired Patients Data obtained from patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance = 0 to 30 mL/min) but without congestive heart failure have demonstrated that the presence of renal impairment significantly increases the terminal elimination half-life of milrinone. Reductions in infusion rate may be necessary in patients with renal impairment. For patients with clinical evidence of renal impairment, the recommended infusion rate can be obtained from the following table: Creatinine Clearance (mL/min/1.73m 2 ) Infusion Rate (mcg/kg/min) 5 0.20 10 0.23 20 0.28 30 0.33 40 0.38 50 0.43 Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine besylate tablets are a calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of: Hypertension ( 1.1 ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Coronary Artery Disease ( 1.2 ) Chronic Stable Angina Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40% \u200b1.1 Hypertension Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program\u2019s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic An g ina (Prinzmetal's or Variant An g ina ) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure.",

( 2.2 ) I mportant Limitation: Doses in excess of 5 mg daily have not been studied in pediatric patients. (2.2) 2.1 Adults The usual initial antihypertensive oral dose of amlodipine besylate tablets is 5 mg once daily, and the maximum dose is 10 mg once daily. Small, fragile, or elderly patients, or patients with hepatic insufficiency may be started on 2.5 mg once daily and this dose may be used when adding amlodipine besylate tablets to other antihypertensive therapy. Adjust dosage according to blood pressure goals. In general, wait 7 to 14 days between titration steps. Titrate more rapidly, however, if clinically warranted, provided the patient is assessed frequently. Angina: The recommended dose for chronic stable or vasospastic angina is 5 to 10 mg, with the lower dose suggested in the elderly and in patients with hepatic insufficiency. Most patients will require 10 mg for adequate effect . Coronary artery disease: The recommended dose range for patients with coronary artery disease is 5 to 10 mg once daily. In clinical studies, the majority of patients required 10 mg [ see Clinical Studies (14.4) ]. 2.2 Children The effective antihypertensive oral dose in pediatric patients ages 6 to 17 years is 2.5 mg to 5 mg once daily.

      "6 ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reaction to amlodipine is edema which occurred in a dose related manner. Other adverse experiences not dose related but reported with an incidence >1% are fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, and somnolence. ( 6 ) To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Oxford, at 1-844-508-1455, 8:00 am -4:30 pm ET, Monday \u2013 Friday or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. 6.1 Clinical Trials Experience Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been evaluated for safety in more than 11,000 patients in U.S. and foreign clinical trials. In general, treatment with amlodipine besylate tablets was well-tolerated at doses up to 10 mg daily. Most adverse reactions reported during therapy with amlodipine besylate tablets were of mild or moderate severity. In controlled clinical trials directly comparing amlodipine besylate tablets (N=1730) at doses up to 10 mg to placebo (N=1250), discontinuation of amlodipine besylate tablets because of adverse reactions was required in only about 1.5% of patients and was not significantly different from placebo (about 1%). The most commonly reported side effects more frequent than placebo are reflected in the table below. The incidence (%) of side effects that occurred in a dose related manner are as follows: Amlodipine Placebo N=520 2.5mg N=275 5 mg N=296 10 mg N=268 Edema 1.8 3.0 10.8 0.6 Dizziness 1.1 3.4 3.4 1.5 Flushing 0.7 1.4 2.6 0.0 Palpitation 0.7 1.4 4.5 0.6 Other adverse reactions that were not clearly dose related but were reported with an incidence greater than 1% in placebo-controlled clinical trials include the following: Amlodipine besylate tablets (%) Placebo (%) N=1730 N=1250 Fatigue 4.5 2.8 Nausea 2.9 1.9 Abdominal pain 1.6 0.3 Somnolence 1.4 0.6 For several adverse experiences that appear to be drug and dose related, there was a greater incidence in women than men associated with amlodipine treatment as shown in the following table: Amlodipine besylate tablets Placebo Male=% (N=1218) Female=% (N=512) Male=% (N=914) Female=% (N=336) Edema 5.6 14.6 1.4 5.1 Flushing 1.5 4.5 0.3 0.9 Palpitations 1.4 3.3 0.9 0.9 Somnolence 1.3 1.6 0.8 0.3 The following events occurred in <1% but >0.1% of patients in controlled clinical trials or under conditions of open trials or marketing experience where a causal relationship is uncertain; they are listed to alert the physician to a possible relationship: Cardiovascular: arrhythmia (including ventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation), bradycardia, chest pain, peripheral ischemia, syncope, tachycardia, vasculitis. Central and Peripheral Nervous System: hypoesthesia, neuropathy peripheral, paresthesia, tremor, vertigo. Gastrointestinal: anorexia, constipation, dysphagia, diarrhea, flatulence, pancreatitis, vomiting, gingival hyperplasia. General: allergic reaction, asthenia, 1 back pain, hot flushes, malaise, pain, rigors, weight gain, weight decrease. Musculoskeletal System: arthralgia, arthrosis, muscle cramps, 1 myalgia. Psychiatric: sexual dysfunction (male 1 and female), insomnia, nervousness, depression, abnormal dreams, anxiety, depersonalization. Respiratory System: dyspnea, 1 epistaxis. Skin and Appendages: angioedema, erythema multiforme, pruritus, 1 rash, 1 rash erythematous, rash maculopapular. Special Senses: abnormal vision, conjunctivitis, diplopia, eye pain, tinnitus. Urinary System: micturition frequency, micturition disorder, nocturia. Autonomic Nervous System: dry mouth, sweating increased. Metabolic and Nutritional: hyperglycemia, thirst. Hemopoietic: leukopenia, purpura, thrombocytopenia. Amlodipine besylate tablets therapy has not been associated with clinically significant changes in routine laboratory tests. No clinically relevant changes were noted in serum potassium, serum glucose, total triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, uric acid, blood urea nitrogen, or creatinine. In the CAMELOT and PREVENT studies [ see Clinical Studies (14.4) ], the adverse event profile was similar to that reported previously (see above), with the most common adverse event being peripheral edema. 1 These events occurred in less than 1% in placebo-controlled trials, but the incidence of these side effects was between 1% and 2% in all multiple dose studies. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. The following postmarketing event has been reported infrequently where a causal relationship is uncertain: gynecomastia. In postmarketing experience, jaundice and hepatic enzyme elevations (mostly consistent with cholestasis or hepatitis), in some cases severe enough to require hospitalization, have been reported in association with use of amlodipine. Postmarketing reporting has also revealed a possible association between extrapyramidal disorder and amlodipine. Amlodipine besylate tablets have been used safely in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, well-compensated congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and abnormal lipid profiles.",

( 8.5 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited available data based on post-marketing reports with amlodipine besylate tablets use in pregnant women are not sufficient to inform a drug-associated risk for major birth defects and miscarriage. There are risks to the mother and fetus associated with poorly controlled hypertension in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations ] . In animal reproduction studies, there was no evidence of adverse developmental effects when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate during organogenesis at doses approximately 10 and 20-times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), respectively. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold). Amlodipine has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose [see Data ]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2%-4% and 15%-20%, respectively. Clinical considerations Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Hypertension in pregnancy increases the maternal risk for pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, premature delivery, and delivery complications (e.g., need for cesarean section and post-partum hemorrhage). Hypertension increases the fetal risk for intrauterine growth restriction and intrauterine death. Pregnant women with hypertension should be carefully monitored and managed accordingly. Data Animal Data No evidence of teratogenicity or other embryo/fetal toxicity was found when pregnant rats and rabbits were treated orally with amlodipine maleate at doses up to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day (approximately 10 and 20 times the MRHD based on body surface area, respectively) during their respective periods of major organogenesis. However for rats, litter size was significantly decreased (by about 50%) and the number of intrauterine deaths was significantly increased (about 5-fold) in rats receiving amlodipine maleate at a dose equivalent to 10 mg amlodipine/kg/day for 14 days before mating and throughout mating and gestation. Amlodipine maleate has been shown to prolong both the gestation period and the duration of labor in rats at this dose. 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary Limited available data from a published clinical lactation study reports that amlodipine is present in human milk at an estimated median relative infant dose of 4.2%. No adverse effects of amlodipine on the breastfed infant have been observed. There is no available information on the effects of amlodipine on milk production. 8.4 Pediatric Use Amlodipine besylate tablets (2.5 to 5 mg daily) are effective in lowering blood pressure in patients 6 to 17 years [ see Clinical Studies (14.1) ]. Effect of Amlodipine besylate tablets on blood pressure in patients less than 6 years of age is not known. 8.5 Geriatric Use Clinical studies of amlodipine besylate tablets did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy.

Single oral amlodipine maleate doses equivalent to 4 or more mg amlodipine/kg or higher in dogs (11 or more times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m 2 basis) caused a marked peripheral vasodilation and hypotension. If massive overdose should occur, initiate active cardiac and respiratory monitoring. Frequent blood pressure measurements are essential. Should hypotension occur, provide cardiovascular support including elevation of the extremities and the judicious administration of fluids. If hypotension remains unresponsive to these conservative measures, consider administration of vasopressors (such as phenylephrine) with attention to circulating volume and urine output. As amlodipine besylate tablets are highly protein bound, hemodialysis is not likely to be of benefit."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist (calcium ion antagonist or slow-channel blocker) that inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into vascular smooth muscle and cardiac muscle. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds to both dihydropyridine and nondihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. Amlodipine inhibits calcium ion influx across cell membranes selectively, with a greater effect on vascular smooth muscle cells than on cardiac muscle cells. Negative inotropic effects can be detected in vitro but such effects have not been seen in intact animals at therapeutic doses. Serum calcium concentration is not affected by amlodipine. Within the physiologic pH range, amlodipine is an ionized compound (pKa=8.6), and its kinetic interaction with the calcium channel receptor is characterized by a gradual rate of association and dissociation with the receptor binding site, resulting in a gradual onset of effect. Amlodipine is a peripheral arterial vasodilator that acts directly on vascular smooth muscle to cause a reduction in peripheral vascular resistance and reduction in blood pressure. The precise mechanisms by which amlodipine relieves angina have not been fully delineated, but are thought to include the following: Exertional Angina: In patients with exertional angina, amlodipine besylate tablets reduce the total peripheral resistance (afterload) against which the heart works and reduces the rate pressure product, and thus myocardial oxygen demand, at any given level of exercise. Vasospastic Angina: Amlodipine besylate tablets have been demonstrated to block constriction and restore blood flow in coronary arteries and arterioles in response to calcium, potassium epinephrine, serotonin, and thromboxane A2 analog in experimental animal models and in human coronary vessels in vitro . This inhibition of coronary spasm is responsible for the effectiveness of amlodipine besylate tablets in vasospastic (Prinzmetal's or variant) angina. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics Hemodynamics: Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine besylate tablets produce vasodilation resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with chronic dosing. Although the acute intravenous administration of amlodipine decreases arterial blood pressure and increases heart rate in hemodynamic studies of patients with chronic stable angina, chronic oral administration of amlodipine in clinical trials did not lead to clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressures in normotensive patients with angina. With chronic once daily oral administration, antihypertensive effectiveness is maintained for at least 24 hours. Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients. The magnitude of reduction in blood pressure with amlodipine besylate tablets is also correlated with the height of pretreatment elevation; thus, individuals with moderate hypertension (diastolic pressure 105 to 114 mmHg) had about a 50% greater response than patients with mild hypertension (diastolic pressure 90 to 104 mmHg). Normotensive subjects experienced no clinically significant change in blood pressures (+1/-2 mmHg). In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets resulted in a decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria. As with other calcium channel blockers, hemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine besylate tablets have generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In hemodynamic studies, amlodipine besylate tablets have not been associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact animals and man, even when coadministered with beta-blockers to man. Similar findings, however, have been observed in normal or well-compensated patients with heart failure with agents possessing significant negative inotropic effects. Electrophysiologic Effects: Amlodipine besylate tablets do not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals or man. In patients with chronic stable angina, intravenous administration of 10 mg did not significantly alter A-H and H-V conduction and sinus node recovery time after pacing. Similar results were obtained in patients receiving amlodipine besylate tablets and concomitant beta-blockers. In clinical studies in which amlodipine besylate tablets were administered in combination with beta-blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic parameters were observed. In clinical trials with angina patients alone, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy did not alter electrocardiographic intervals or produce higher degrees of AV blocks. Drug interactions Sildenafil: When amlodipine and sildenafil were used in combination, each agent independently exerted its own blood pressure lowering effect [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine besylate tablets, absorption produces peak plasma concentrations between 6 and 12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been estimated to be between 64 and 90%. The bioavailability of amlodipine besylate tablets is not altered by the presence of food. Amlodipine is extensively (about 90%) converted to inactive metabolites via hepatic metabolism with 10% of the parent compound and 60% of the metabolites excreted in the urine. Ex vivo studies have shown that approximately 93% of the circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins in hypertensive patients. Elimination from the plasma is biphasic with a terminal elimination half-life of about 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels of amlodipine are reached after 7 to 8 days of consecutive daily dosing. The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. Patients with renal failure may therefore receive the usual initial dose. Elderly patients and patients with hepatic insufficiency have decreased clearance of amlodipine with a resulting increase in AUC of approximately 40 to 60%, and a lower initial dose may be required. A similar increase in AUC was observed in patients with moderate to severe heart failure. Drug interactions In vitro data indicate that amlodipine has no effect on the human plasma protein binding of digoxin, phenytoin, warfarin, and indomethacin. Impact of other dru g s on amlodipine Co-administered cimetidine, magnesium-and aluminum hydroxide antacids, sildenafil, and grapefruit juice have no impact on the exposure to amlodipine. CYP3A inhibitors: Co-administration of a 180 mg daily dose of diltiazem with 5 mg amlodipine in elderly hypertensive patients resulted in a 60% increase in amlodipine systemic exposure. Erythromycin co\u2011administration in healthy volunteers did not significantly change amlodipine systemic exposure. However, strong inhibitors of CYP3A (e.g., itraconazole, clarithromycin) may increase the plasma concentrations of amlodipine to a greater extent [ see Drug Interactions (7.1) ]. Impact of amlodipine on other dru g s Amlodipine is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A and may increase exposure to CYP3A substrates. Co-administered amlodipine does not affect the exposure to atorvastatin, digoxin, ethanol and the warfarin prothrombin response time. Simvastatin: Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg of amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77% increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Cyclosporine: A prospective study in renal transplant patients (N=11) showed on an average of 40% increase in trough cyclosporine levels when concomitantly treated with amlodipine [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. Tacrolimus: A prospective study in healthy Chinese volunteers (N=9) with CYP3A5 expressers showed a 2.5\u2011to 4-fold increase in tacrolimus exposure when concomitantly administered with amlodipine compared to tacrolimus alone. This finding was not observed in CYP3A5 non-expressers (N= 6). However, a 3-fold increase in plasma exposure to tacrolimus in a renal transplant patient (CYP3A5 non-expresser) upon initiation of amlodipine for the treatment of post-transplant hypertension resulting in reduction of tacrolimus dose has been reported. Irrespective of the CYP3A5 genotype status, the possibility of an interaction cannot be excluded with these drugs [ see Drug Interactions (7.2) ]. 12.4 Pediatric Patients Sixty-two hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years received doses of amlodipine besylate tablets between 1.25 mg and 20 mg.

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Effects in Hypertension Adult Patients The antihypertensive efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets has been demonstrated in a total of 15 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized studies involving 800 patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 538 on placebo. Once daily administration produced statistically significant placebo-corrected reductions in supine and standing blood pressures at 24 hours postdose, averaging about 12/6 mmHg in the standing position and 13/7 mmHg in the supine position in patients with mild to moderate hypertension. Maintenance of the blood pressure effect over the 24-hour dosing interval was observed, with little difference in peak and trough effect. Tolerance was not demonstrated in patients studied for up to 1 year. The 3 parallel, fixed dose, dose response studies showed that the reduction in supine and standing blood pressures was dose-related within the recommended dosing range. Effects on diastolic pressure were similar in young and older patients. The effect on systolic pressure was greater in older patients, perhaps because of greater baseline systolic pressure. Effects were similar in black patients and in white patients. Pediatric Patients Two hundred sixty-eight hypertensive patients aged 6 to 17 years were randomized first to amlodipine besylate tablets 2.5 or 5 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then randomized again to the same dose or to placebo for another 4 weeks. Patients receiving 2.5 mg or 5 mg at the end of 8 weeks had significantly lower systolic blood pressure than those secondarily randomized to placebo. The magnitude of the treatment effect is difficult to interpret, but it is probably less than 5 mmHg systolic on the 5 mg dose and 3.3 mmHg systolic on the 2.5 mg dose. Adverse events were similar to those seen in adults. 14.2 Effects in Chronic Stable Angina The effectiveness of 5 to 10 mg/day of amlodipine besylate tablets in exercise-induced angina has been evaluated in 8 placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trials of up to 6 weeks duration involving 1038 patients (684 amlodipine besylate tablets, 354 placebo) with chronic stable angina. In 5 of the 8 studies, significant increases in exercise time (bicycle or treadmill) were seen with the 10 mg dose. Increases in symptom-limited exercise time averaged 12.8% (63 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg, and averaged 7.9% (38 sec) for amlodipine besylate tablets 5 mg. Amlodipine besylate tablets 10 mg also increased time to 1 mm ST segment deviation in several studies and decreased angina attack rate. The sustained efficacy of amlodipine besylate tablets in angina patients has been demonstrated over long-term dosing. In patients with angina, there were no clinically significant reductions in blood pressures (4/1 mmHg) or changes in heart rate (+0.3 bpm). 14.3 Effects in Vasospastic Angina In a double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4 weeks duration in 50 patients, amlodipine besylate tablets therapy decreased attacks by approximately 4/week compared with a placebo decrease of approximately 1/week (p<0.01). Two of 23 amlodipine besylate tablets and 7 of 27 placebo patients discontinued from the study due to lack of clinical improvement. 14.4 Effects in Documented Coronary Artery Disease In PREVENT, 825 patients with angiographically documented coronary artery disease were randomized to amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo and followed for 3 years. Although the study did not show significance on the primary objective of change in coronary luminal diameter as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, the data suggested a favorable outcome with respect to fewer hospitalizations for angina and revascularization procedures in patients with CAD. CAMELOT enrolled 1318 patients with CAD recently documented by angiography, without left main coronary disease and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%. Patients (76% males, 89% Caucasian, 93% enrolled at U.S. sites, 89% with a history of angina, 52% without PCI, 4% with PCI and no stent, and 44% with a stent) were randomized to double-blind treatment with either amlodipine besylate tablets (5 to 10 mg once daily) or placebo in addition to standard care that included aspirin (89%), statins (83%), beta-blockers (74%), nitroglycerin (50%), anti-coagulants (40%), and diuretics (32%), but excluded other calcium channel blockers. The mean duration of follow-up was 19 months. The primary endpoint was the time to first occurrence of one of the following events: hospitalization for angina pectoris, coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease. A total of 110 (16.6%) and 151 (23.1%) first events occurred in the amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo groups, respectively, for a hazard ratio of 0.691 (95% CI: 0.540\u20130.884, p = 0.003). The primary endpoint is summarized in Figure 1 below. The outcome of this study was largely derived from the prevention of hospitalizations for angina and the prevention of revascularization procedures (see Table 1 ). Effects in various subgroups are shown in Figure 2 . In an angiographic substudy (n=274) conducted within CAMELOT, there was no significant difference between amlodipine and placebo on the change of atheroma volume in the coronary artery as assessed by intravascular ultrasound. F igure 1 - Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Composite Clinical Outcomes for Amlodipine versus Placebo Figure 2 \u2013 Effects on Primary Endpoint of Amlodipine Besylate Tablets versus Placebo across Sub- Groups Table 1 below summarizes the significant composite endpoint and clinical outcomes from the composites of the primary endpoint. The other components of the primary endpoint including cardiovascular death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke/TIA, or peripheral vascular disease did not demonstrate a significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo. Table 1.

In these studies, there was no evidence of worsened heart failure based on measures of exercise tolerance, NYHA classification, symptoms, or left ventricular ejection fraction. In a long-term (follow-up at least 6 months, mean 13.8 months) placebo- controlled mortality/morbidity study of amlodipine besylate tablets 5 to 10 mg in 1153 patients with NYHA Classes III (n=931) or IV (n=222) heart failure on stable doses of diuretics, digoxin, and ACE inhibitors, amlodipine besylate tablets had no effect on the primary endpoint of the study which was the combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity (as defined by life-threatening arrhythmia, acute myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for worsened heart failure), or on NYHA classification, or symptoms of heart failure. Total combined all-cause mortality and cardiac morbidity events were 222/571 (39%) for patients on amlodipine besylate tablets and 246/583 (42%) for patients on placebo; the cardiac morbid events represented about 25% of the endpoints in the study. Another study (PRAISE-2) randomized patients with NYHA Class III (80%) or IV (20%) heart failure without clinical symptoms or objective evidence of underlying ischemic disease, on stable doses of ACE inhibitors (99%), digitalis (99%), and diuretics (99%), to placebo (n=827) or amlodipine besylate tablets (n=827) and followed them for a mean of 33 months. There was no statistically significant difference between amlodipine besylate tablets and placebo in the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality (95% confidence limits from 8% reduction to 29% increase on amlodipine besylate tablets). With amlodipine besylate tablets there were more reports of pulmonary edema."

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION: Each gram of Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur (sodium sulfacetamide 10% w/w and sulfur 5% w/w) contains 100 mg of sodium sulfacetamide and 50 mg of colloidal sulfur in a vehicle consisting of: aloe vera leaf extract, butylated hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, disodium oleamido monoethanolamine sulfosuccinate, edetate disodium, fragrance, glycerin, glyceryl monostearate, magnesium aluminum silicate, methylparaben, PEG-100 stearate, propylparaben, purified water, sodium cocoyl isethionate, sodium methyl cocoyl taurate, sodium thiosulfate, stearyl alcohol, xanthan gum. Sodium sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity while sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Sodium sulfacetamide is C 8 H 9 N 2 NaO 3 S\u00b7H 2 O with molecular weight of 254.24. Chemically, it is N-[(4-aminophenyl)sulfonyl]-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is: image description"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids."
    ],
    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS: Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% & Sulfur 5% Cleanser is indicated in the topical control of acne vulgaris, acne rosacea and seborrheic dermatitis."
    ],
    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS: Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% & Sulfur 5% Cleanser is contraindicated for use by patients having known hypersensitivity to sulfonamides, sulfur, or any other component of this preparation. Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% & Sulfur 5% Cleanser is not to be used by patients with kidney disease."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNING Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved. Sulfonamides are known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome in hypersensitive individuals. Stevens- Johnson syndrome also has been reported following the use of sodium sulfacetamide topically. Cases of drug induced systemic lupus erythematosus from topical sulfacetamide also have been reported. In one of these cases, there was a fatal outcome. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONSFOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE General If irritation develops, use of this product should be discontinued and appropriate therapy instituted. Patients should be very carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long- term therapy. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but Sodium Sulfacetamide and Sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis and Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential. PREGNANCY Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Sulfacetamide 9% & Sulfur 4.5% Wash. It is also not known whether Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% & Sulfur 5% Cleanser can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% & Sulfur 5% Cleanser should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. NURSING MOTHERS It is not known whether Sodium Sulfacetamide is excreted in human milk following topical use of Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% & Sulfur 5% Cleanser. However, small amounts of orally administered sulfonamides have been reported to be eliminated in human milk. In view of this and because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% & Sulfur 5% Cleanser is administered to a nursing woman. PEDIATRIC USE Safety and effectiveness in children under the age of 12 has not been established."

    "adverse_reactions": [
      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Although rare, sodium sulfacetamide may cause local irritation. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact the FDA at 1-800- FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Wash affected areas with Sodium Sulfacetamide 10%, and Sulfur 5% Cleanser one to two times daily, or as directed by your physician. Avoid contact with eyes or mucous membranes. Wet skin and liberally apply to areas to be cleansed, massage gently into skin for 10 to 20 seconds, working into a full lather, rinse thoroughly and pat dry. If drying occurs, it may be controlled by rinsing cleanser off sooner or using cleanser less often."

      "DESCRIPTION Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose in water for injection. Each 100 mL contains 1 g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose, hydrous 5 g in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in a 1% concentration. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage form and size. Magnesium sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose, monohydrate, a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: C 6 H 12 O 6 \u2022 H 2 O M.W. 198.17 Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( free flex \u00ae bag). The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container\u2019s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00baC/77\u00baF during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol",

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .

Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP may be administered intravenously. The rate of IV infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 7.5 mL of a 2% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. After the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained, and the maximum recommended dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion.",

      "WARNINGS In patients on corticosteroid therapy subjected to unusual stress, increased dosage of rapidly acting corticosteroids before, during, and after the stressful situation is indicated. Immunosuppression and Increased Risk of Infection Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infection with any pathogen, including viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic pathogens. Corticosteroids can: Reduce resistance to new infections Exacerbate existing infections Increase the risk of disseminated infections Increase the risk of reactivation or exacerbation of latent infections Mask some signs of infection Corticosteroid-associated infections can be mild but can be severe and at times fatal. The rate of infectious complications increases with increasing corticosteroid dosages. Monitor for the development of infection and consider PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction as needed. Tuberculosis If PredniSONE Tablets USP is used to treat a condition in patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity, reactivation of tuberculosis may occur. Closely monitor such patients for reactivation. During prolonged PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy, patients with latent tuberculosis or tuberculin reactivity should receive chemoprophylaxis. Varicella Zoster and Measles Viral Infections Varicella and measles can have a serious or even fatal course in non-immune patients taking corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. In corticosteroid-treated patients who have not had these diseases or are nonimmune, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure to varicella and measles: If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to varicella, prophylaxis with varicella zoster immune globulin may be indicated. If varicella develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. If a PredniSONE Tablets USP-treated patient is exposed to measles, prophylaxis with immunoglobulin may be indicated. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation Hepatitis B virus reactivation can occur in patients who are hepatitis B carriers treated with immunosuppressive dosages of corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP. Reactivation can also occur infrequently in corticosteroid-treated patients who appear to have resolved hepatitis B infection. Screen patients for hepatitis B infection before initiating immunosuppressive (e.g., prolonged) treatment with PredniSONE Tablets USP. For patients who show evidence of hepatitis B infection, recommend consultation with physicians with expertise in managing hepatitis B regarding monitoring and consideration for hepatitis B antiviral therapy. Fungal Infections Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may exacerbate systemic fungal infections; therefore, avoid PredniSONE Tablets USP use in the presence of such infections unless PredniSONE Tablets USP is needed to control drug reactions. For patients on chronic PredniSONE Tablets USP therapy who develop systemic fungal infections, PredniSONE Tablets USP withdrawal or dosage reduction is recommended. Amebiasis Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, may activate latent amebiasis. Therefore, it is recommended that latent amebiasis or active amebiasis be ruled out before initiating PredniSONE Tablets USP in patients who have spent time in the tropics or patients with unexplained diarrhea. Strongyloides Infestation Corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, should be used with great care in patients with known or suspected Strongyloides (threadworm) infestation. In such patients, corticosteroid-induced immunosuppression may lead to Strongyloides hyperinfection and dissemination with widespread larval migration, often accompanied by severe enterocolitis and potentially fatal gramnegative septicemia. Cerebral Malaria Avoid corticosteroids, including PredniSONE Tablets USP, in patients with cerebral malaria. Kaposi\u2019s Sarcoma Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma has been reported to occur in patients receiving corticosteroid therapy, most often for chronic conditions. Discontinuation of corticosteroids may result in clinical improvement of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma. Prolonged use of corticosteroids may produce posterior subcapsular cataracts, glaucoma with possible damage to the optic nerves, and may enhance the establishment of secondary ocular infections due to fungi or viruses. Usage in pregnancy Since adequate human reproduction studies have not been done with corticosteroids, the use of these drugs in pregnancy, nursing mothers or women of child-bearing potential requires that the possible benefits of the drug be weighed against the potential hazards to the mother and embryo or fetus. Infants born of mothers who have received substantial doses of corticosteroids during pregnancy, should be carefully observed for signs of hypoadrenalism. Average and large doses of hydrocortisone or cortisone can cause elevation of blood pressure, salt and water retention, and increased excretion of potassium. These effects are less likely to occur with the synthetic derivatives except when used in large doses. Dietary salt restriction and potassium supplementation may be necessary. All corticosteroids increase calcium excretion. While on corticosteroid therapy patients should not be vaccinated against smallpox. Other immunization procedures should not be undertaken in patients who are on corticosteroids, especially on high dose, because of possible hazards of neurological complications and a lack of antibody response."

    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Precautions Drug-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency may be minimized by gradual reduction of dosage. This type of relative insufficiency may persist for months after discontinuation of therapy; therefore, in any situation of stress occurring during that period, hormone therapy should be reinstituted. Since mineralocorticoid secretion may be impaired, salt and/or a mineralocorticoid should be administered concurrently. There is an enhanced effect of corticosteroids on patients with hypothyroidism and in those with cirrhosis. Corticosteroids should be used cautiously in patients with ocular herpes simplex because of possible corneal perforation. The lowest possible dose of corticosteroid should be used to control the condition under treatment, and when reduction in dosage is possible, the reduction should be gradual. Psychic derangements may appear when corticosteroids are used, ranging from euphoria, insomnia, mood swings, personality changes, and severe depression, to frank psychotic manifestations. Also, existing emotional instability or psychotic tendencies may be aggravated by corticosteroids. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in hypoprothrombinemia. Steroids should be used with caution in nonspecific ulcerative colitis, if there is a probability of impending perforation, abscess or other pyogenic infection; diverticulitis; fresh intestinal anastomoses; active or latent peptic ulcer; renal insufficiency; hypertension; osteoporosis; and myasthenia gravis. Growth and development of infants and children on prolonged corticosteroid therapy should be carefully observed. Although controlled clinical trials have shown corticosteroids to be effective in speeding the resolution of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, they do not show that corticosteroids affect the ultimate outcome or natural history of the disease. The studies do show that relatively high doses of corticosteroids are necessary to demonstrate a significant effect (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Since complications of treatment with glucocorticoids are dependent on the size of the dose and the duration of treatment, a risk/benefit decision must be made in each individual case as to dose and duration of treatment and as to whether daily or intermittent therapy should be used. Convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Since concurrent use of these agents results in a mutual inhibition of metabolism, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. Information for Patients Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chicken pox or measles and, if exposed, to obtain medical advice."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT . After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient\u2019s individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient\u2019s condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly. Multiple Sclerosis In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.) ADT \u00ae (Alternate Day Therapy) ADT is a corticosteroid dosing regimen in which twice the usual daily dose of corticoid is administered every other morning. The purpose of this mode of therapy is to provide the patient requiring long-term pharmacologic dose treatment with the beneficial effects of corticoids while minimizing certain undesirable effects, including pituitary-adrenal suppression, the Cushingoid state, corticoid withdrawal symptoms, and growth suppression in children. The rationale for this treatment schedule is based on two major premises: (a) the anti-inflammatory or therapeutic effect of corticoids persists longer than their physical presence and metabolic effects and (b) administration of the corticosteroid every other morning allows for re-establishment of more nearly normal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activity on the off-steroid day. A brief review of the HPA physiology may be helpful in understanding this rationale. Acting primarily through the hypothalamus a fall in free cortisol stimulates the pituitary gland to produce increasing amounts of corticotropin (ACTH) while a rise in free cortisol inhibits ACTH secretion. Normally the HPA system is characterized by diurnal (circadian) rhythm. Serum levels of ACTH rise from a low point about 10 pm to a peak level about 6 am. Increasing levels of ACTH stimulate adrenocortical activity resulting in a rise in plasma cortisol with maximal levels occurring between 2 am and 8 am. This rise in cortisol dampens ACTH production and in turn adrenocortical activity. There is a gradual fall in plasma corticoids during the day with lowest levels occurring about midnight. The diurnal rhythm of the HPA axis is lost in Cushing\u2019s disease, a syndrome of adrenocortical hyperfunction characterized by obesity with centripetal fat distribution, thinning of the skin with easy bruisability, muscle wasting with weakness, hypertension, latent diabetes, osteoporosis, electrolyte imbalance, etc. The same clinical findings of hyperadrenocorticism may be noted during long-term pharmacologic dose corticoid therapy administered in conventional daily divided doses. It would appear, then, that a disturbance in the diurnal cycle with maintenance of elevated corticoid values during the night may play a significant role in the development of undesirable corticoid effects. Escape from these constantly elevated plasma levels for even short periods of time may be instrumental in protecting against undesirable pharmacologic effects. During conventional pharmacologic dose corticosteroid therapy, ACTH production is inhibited with subsequent suppression of cortisol production by the adrenal cortex. Recovery time for normal HPA activity is variable depending upon the dose and duration of treatment. During this time the patient is vulnerable to any stressful situation. Although it has been shown that there is considerably less adrenal suppression following a single morning dose of prednisolone (10 mg) as opposed to a quarter of that dose administered every 6 hours, there is evidence that some suppressive effect on adrenal activity may be carried over into the following day when pharmacologic doses are used. Further, it has been shown that a single dose of certain corticosteroids will produce adrenocortical suppression for two or more days. Other corticoids, including methylprednisolone, hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone, are considered to be short acting (producing adrenocortical suppression for 1\u00bc to 1\u00bd days following a single dose) and thus are recommended for alternate day therapy. The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy: Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids. ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated. In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended.Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable. Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum. As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone). The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am). In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed. In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted. Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

    "description": [
      "DESCRIPTION: Sulfacetamide Sodium is a sulfonamide with antibacterial activity while Sulfur acts as a keratolytic agent. Chemically Sulfacetamide Sodium is N-[(4-aminophenyl) sulfonyl]-acetamide, monosodium salt, monohydrate. The structural formula is: Each gram of Sodium Sulfacetamide 10% and Sulfur 5% Cleanser contains 100 mg of Sodium Sulfacetamide and 50 mg of sulfur in a formulation containing: Aloe Vera Leaf, Butylated Hydroxytoluene, Camellia 0leifera Leaf, Cetyl Alcohol, Disodium Oleamido Monoethanolamine Sulfosuccinate, Edetate Disodium, Glycerin, Glyceryl Monostearate, Magnesium Aluminum Silicate, Methylpara\u00adben, Peg-100 Stearate, Propylparaben, Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate, Sodium Methyl Cocoyl Taurate, Sodium Thiosulfate, Stearyl Alcohol, Water, Xanthan Gum structure"
    ],
    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the Woods-Fildes theory, which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sulfacetamide sodium is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is not known, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids."

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Sodium sulfacetamide exerts a bacteriostatic effect against sulfonamide sensitive Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms commonly isolated from secondary cutaneous pyogenic infections. It acts by restricting the synthesis of folic acid required by bacteria for growth, by its competition with para-aminobenzoic acid. There is no clinical data available on the degree and rate of systemic absorption of this product when applied to the skin or scalp. However, significant absorption of sodium sulfacetamide through the skin has been reported. The following in vitro data is available, but the clinical significance is unknown. Organisms that show susceptibility to sodium sulfacetamide are: Streptococci, Staphylococci, E. coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas pyocyanea, Salmonella species, Proteus vulgaris, Nocardia and Actinomyces. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown, but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of Propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids."

      "WARNINGS: Sulfonamides are known to cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome in hypersensitive individuals. Stevens-Johnson syndrome also has been reported following the use of sodium sulfacetamide topically. Cases of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus from topical sulfacetamide also have been reported. In one of these cases, there was a fatal outcome. KEEP OUT OF THE REACH OF CHILDREN. FOR EXTERNAL USE ONLY. NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE. General: Nonsusceptible organisms, including fungi, may proliferate with the use of this preparation. Although rare, sensitivity to sodium sulfacetamide may occur. Therefore, caution and careful supervision should be observed when prescribing this drug for patients who may be prone to hypersensitivity to topical sulfonamides. If the use of this product produces signs of hypersensitivity or other untoward reactions, discontinue use of the preparation. Patients should be carefully observed for possible local irritation or sensitization during long-term therapy. Systemic toxic reactions such as agranulocytosis, acute hemolytic anemia, purpura hemorrhagica, drug fever, jaundice and contact dermatitis indicate hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Particular caution should be employed if areas of denuded or abraded skin are involved. Systemic absorption of topical sulfonamides is greater following application to large, infected, abraded, denuded, or severely burned areas. Under these circumstances, any of the adverse effects produced by the systemic administration of these agents could potentially occur, and appropriate observations and laboratory determinations should be performed. The object of this therapy is to achieve desquamation without irritation, but sodium sulfacetamide and sulfur can cause reddening and scaling of the epidermis. These side effects are not unusual in the treatment of acne vulgaris, but patients should be cautioned about the possibility. Information for Patients: Patients should discontinue the use of this product if the condition becomes worse or if a rash develops in the area being treated or elsewhere. The use of this product also should be discontinued promptly, and the physician notified if any arthritis, fever, or sores in the mouth develop. Avoid contact with eyes, lips and mucous membranes. Drug Interactions: This product is incompatible with silver preparations. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility: Long-term animal studies for carcinogenic potential have not been performed on this product to date. Studies on reproduction and fertility also have not been performed. Chromosomal nondisjunction has been reported in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, following application of sodium sulfacetamide. The significance of this finding to the topical use of sodium sulfacetamide in the human is unknown. Pregnancy: Category C. Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with this product. It is also not known whether this product can affect reproduction capacity or cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. This product should be used by a pregnant woman only if clearly needed or when potential benefits outweigh potential hazards to the fetus. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when this product is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use: Safety and effectiveness in children under the age of 12 years have not been established.",

Who may use Men's Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5 % (Foam)? Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) is for use only by men. Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) may be appropriate for you if you are a male at least 18 years old and experiencing gradually thinning hair or gradual hair loss on the top of the scalp (vertex only, as shown below). It is not intended for frontal baldness or a receding hairline. The common inherited thinning or hair loss process begins slowly and may become noticeable only after years of gradual loss. Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) is for men with hair loss or thinning hair that begins on the vertex of the scalp. Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) is more likely to regrow hair in men with hair loss in the range shown below. If men have more hair loss than shown, Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) may not work. Many of those experiencing hair loss have other family members with gradually thinning hair or hair loss. If you have no family history of gradually thinning hair or of gradual hair loss, or your hair loss is patchy, see your doctor. Who should NOT use Men 's Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam)? Women should not use Men's Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam). Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) should not be used on babies or children under 18 years old.

Also, Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) will not improve hair loss due to: damage from the use of hair care products which cause scarring or deep burns of the scalp. hair grooming methods such as cornrowing or ponytails which require pulling the hair tightly back from the scalp.

Not everyone will respond to Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam). The response to Men's Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) cannot be predicted. It is unlikely anyone will be able to grow back all their hair. However, to see your best results with Men's Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam), make sure you get the medicine directly to the scalp and apply it twice a day, every day. You may get better results if you have been losing your hair for a short period of time or have little hair loss. However, for some men Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) may not work. How soon can I expect results from using Men's Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam)? Since normal hair usually grows only 1/2 to 1 inch per month, hair regrowth with Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) also takes time. Results may be seen as early as 2 months with twice daily use. For some men, it may take at least 4 months for results to be seen. If you do not see any results after 4 months, stop using Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% (Foam) and seek the advice of your physician.

However, if it continues after two weeks, see your physician. If Men 's Minoxidil Topical Aerosol 5% ( Foam) is working, what will the hair look like?

      "2. DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 2.1. To open blister package, peel cover film back 4/5 of its length. 2.2. Prepare the blood bag following your institution's standard operating procedures. 2.2.1. Materials Needed : Evacuated blood collection tubes (glass or plastic) 2.3. Make a loose knot in the donor tubing below the \"Y\" and CLIKTIP (inline closure device) unless alternate methods are used to seal the tubing at the end of collection. 2.4. Temporarily clamp donor tubing between the phlebotomy needle and the \"Y\". 2.5. Suspend the collection bag as far as possible below the donor's arm. 2.6. Apply blood pressure cuff or tourniquet to donor's arm. Disinfect site of phlebotomy. If blood pressure cuff is used, inflate to approximately 60 mmHg. 2.7. Remove the needle cover and perform phlebotomy. Remove the temporary clamp on the donor tubing to permit blood flow into the Diversion Blood Sampling Arm pouch. 2.7.1. CAUTION: Do not touch the needle after removing the needle cover. 2.8. Secure the needle safety device in place following the device instructions provided on the reverse side. 2.9. Secure donor tubing to donor's arm. 2.10. Position the diversion pouch with the notches up and the Tube Holder/Luer Adapter assembly down. When the level of blood in the pouch is approximately in line with the notches, the diversion pouch is full. (Fig. 2a) 2.10.1. NOTE: The approximate fill volume of the pouch at the notches is 35 mL. 2.11. Permanently seal the tubing between the \"Y\" and the diversion pouch to maintain a closed system using an aluminum clip or a tube sealer approved for use with tubing connected to a donor (Fig. 2b). 2.11.1. CAUTION: Do not use a dielectric tube sealer to seal the tubing while the needle is connected to the donor's body unless it is approved for such a purpose. 2.12. To initiate blood flow into the collection bag, break the CLIKTIP between the \"Y\" and the collection bag. 2.13. To avoid clot formation, collect samples as soon as possible from the diversion pouch as follows (Fig. 2b). 2.13.1. CAUTION: Do not collect donor test samples until the tubing between the \"Y\" and the diversion pouch is permanently sealed. 2.13.2. Break the CLIKTIP in the tubing below the pouch to open the pathway for sampling. (Fig. 2b) 2.13.3. Position the diversion pouch with the notches up and the Tube Holder/Luer Adapter assembly downward. Assure that any air in the pouch is at the top and will not enter the blood collection tubes. 2.13.4. Open the Tube Holder lid and insert blood collection tube firmly into the tube holder; when full, remove sample tube from holder. Repeat to collect additional samples. 2.13.5. NOTE: The pouch may be removed after the donor test samples are collected. A second seal must be made between the diversion pouch and the permanent seal prior to removing the pouch. 2.14. Mix blood with anticoagulant in the collection bag and continue to mix at several intervals during collection and immediately after collection. If using an automated mixer, follow manufacturer's instructions. 2.15. Collect labeled volume of blood 500 mL \u00b110%. 2.16. When the desired amount of blood has been collected, seal the tubing or tighten the loose knot (white knot) prepared in Step 2.3. Make a second seal between the first seal or knot and the \"Y\". Various methods may be used to seal tubing. 2.17. Release pressure on the donor's arm and remove the needle into the needle safety device following the device instructions provided on the reverse side. Sever the donor tubing between the two seals previously made below the CLIKTIP and \"Y\". 2.17.1. CAUTION: Discard the Diversion Blood Sampling Arm and phlebotomy needle/donor tubing according to institutional standard operating procedures. 2.18. Seal and remove donor tubing from collection bag or strip donor tubing as follows: 2.18.1. To obtain a quality control prefiltration sample, strip blood from donor tubing into collection bag, mix well, and allow tubing to refill; repeat once. To prevent the blood from clotting in the tubing, work quickly as possible. Leave an adequate length of tubing containing the well-mixed anticoagulated whole blood attached to the collection bag. 2.18.2. Or, to maximize collection recovery, strip the tubing, mix well and seal tubing close to the collection bag without refilling. To prevent the blood from clotting in the tubing, work quickly as possible. Remove tubing from collection bag. 2.19. The blood filtration is executed according to the following operation. (see Fig.3 and Fig.4 ) 2.19.1. NOTE: Wait 1 hour after collection before filtering. Filtration can be accomplished when blood is stored at room temperature for up to eight hours after collection. 2.19.2. NOTE: The band guides used to bundle the coiled tubing to prevent entanglement during shipping should be removed prior to filtration (not depicted). 2.20. Mix the unfiltered whole blood unit by inverting the collection bag #1 (pre-filter bag) several times. 2.21. Hang the collection bag #1, and extend the filtration set to 85 \u00b1 2.5 cm or 33.5 \u00b1 1 inch. Verify that the filter is vertical and ensure all tubing is freely suspended. Position and support bags #2-4 on a flat surface (Fig. 4). 2.21.1. NOTE: This distance is measured from the outlet of the collection bag to the position of the supported bags as indicated in Fig. 4. 2.21.2. NOTE: Verity tubing has been removed from the tube guides and extends freely. 2.22. Break the CLIKTIP at the outlet of the collection bag #1, and start filtration. 2.22.1. CAUTION: Do not squeeze the collection bag during filtration. 2.22.2. CAUTION: Do not squeeze or apply pressure on the filter while it is attached to the bag containing the filtered blood. 2.22.3. CAUTION: If for any reason whole blood passes through the one-way valve, stop filtration immediately and consider the product as non-leukocyte reduced. 2.23. Filtration ends when the collection bag is empty or blood flow has stopped. Close the WHITE clamp above the filter. 2.24. Expel air through the bypass line and back into the empty collection bag #1 by holding the primary bag #2 upright so that the air will be closest to the ports. Gently squeeze the primary bag containing the leukoreduced whole blood until filtered blood reaches the \"Y\" below the filter. To ensure ease of air removal ensure primary bag #2 is below the filter outlet. 2.25. Open the WHITE clamp. 2.26. Recovery of filtered Whole Blood is complete when the collection bag and the inlet side of the filter have drained or blood flow has stopped. Close the WHITE clamp. 2.27. Seal the tubing as close as possible to the \"Y\" below the filter and properly dispose of the filter and collection bag #1. 2.28. Strip the post filter tubing into the primary bag #2, mix well, and allow tubing to refill; repeat once. Make an appropriate number of segments of anticoagulated blood for testing by sealing on or near the X marks. Leave segments attached to the filtered whole blood unit. 2.29. The time between Whole Blood collection and component separation may vary depending on both the blood bag system and processing options selected. 2.29.1. NOTE: Platelets should be separated from the Red Blood Cells within 8 hours of blood collection. 2.29.2. NOTE: Fresh Frozen Plasma should be separated from the Red Blood Cells and placed in a freezer at \u201318\u00baC or colder within 8 hours of collection. 2.29.3. NOTE: OPTISOL should be added to the Red Blood Cells immediately after removal of the plasma. If plasma is not separated from the Red Blood Cells within 8 hours, OPTISOL may be added within 72 hours of collection if Whole Blood is refrigerated. 2.29.4. NOTE: Other plasma components may be prepared following approved regulations and standards. 2.30. Follow your institution's standard component processing procedures to prepare components. 2.31. Centrifuge filtered whole blood unit to separate red blood cells from platelet rich plasma. 2.32. Break the CLIKTIP of primary bag #2 and transfer leukocytes-reduced platelet rich plasma into XT-612 Platelet bag #3. Clamp the transfer tubing on the Platelet bag. 2.33. Break the CLIKTIP of the OPTISOL bag #4 and drain contents into primary bag #2 containing red blood cells. Seal tubing of primary bag in two places, and cut between seals and separate from Platelet and OPTISOL bags. 2.33.1. NOTE: Empty OPTISOL bag is used for further component preparation. 2.34. Invert the red blood cell \u2013 OPTISOL mixture several times to assure the final product is well suspended. 2.35. Store AS-5 Red Blood Cells, Leukocytes Reduced between 1-6\u00b0C for up to 42 days. 2.35.1. NOTE: Whole Blood or Red Blood Cells in CPD may be stored for up to 21 days at 1-6\u00b0C. 2.36.

      "PROCEDURE FOR USE OF DonorCare\u2122 Needle Guard This device is for use by trained individuals. Intended Use The DonorCare Needle Guard is incorporated onto the donor tubing to shield the needle immediately after withdrawal from the donor. Single Use Only. Preparation 1. Move the DonorCare on the tubing ensuring that it slides easily and the arrow is pointing toward the needle hub. 2. Ensure that the three lock points on the DonorCare are locked closed. Whole Blood Collection 3. Perform the phlebotomy as per your institution's standard operating procedures. 4. Slide the DonorCare over the needle hub so that it covers approximately one half to two thirds of the needle hub. 5. Stabilize the DonorCare to the arm by placing a piece of tape over the front end so that the tape does not extend over the front of the DonorCare. Withdrawal of Needle Important The DonorCare must be held stationary while the needle is withdrawn into it. Caution The needle must be fully shielded by DonorCare to prevent accidental injury. 6. Hold gauze over the venipuncture site with finger tips without exerting pressure. Hold the sides of the DonorCare near the front with the index finger and thumb of the same hand. 7. With the other hand, hold the donor tubing close behind the DonorCare. Note: A hemostat may be placed on the tubing behind the DonorCare when the blood collection is complete. This will help to prevent blood drops from forming. 8. Pull tubing smoothly and swiftly with one motion until the needle is locked in place inside the DonorCare. 9. Confirm that the needle is locked by: Listening for two 'clicks' as the needle is drawn into DonorCare. If the clicks are not heard as the needle is drawn into the DonorCare, continue to pull firmly on the tubing to assure needle is fully withdrawn into DonorCare. 10. Visually check that the needle is fully shielded by DonorCare before removing from the donor's arm. 11. Remove the tape from the DonorCare and arm. 12. Apply pressure to the gauze covering the venipuncture site. Warning Do not place fingers at the opening of DonorCare after removal from the donor's arm. Difficult Phlebotomy (Examples may include: Slow blood flow, deep or fine vein, steep angle) It may be necessary to delay placing the DonorCare over the needle hub until the end of the blood collection. In such situations: Leave the DonorCare on the tubing behind the needle hub. At the end of the blood collection carefully remove the tape from the needle hub and slide the DonorCare over the hub so that it covers approximately one half to two thirds of the needle hub. Withdraw the needle into the DonorCare as stated in steps 6. through 12. above. Rx ONLY DonorCare is manufactured by ITL Corporation, Melbourne, Australia.

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ZINC has been identified as a cofactor for over 70 different enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase, lactic dehydrogenase and both RNA and DNA polymerase. Zinc facilitates wound healing, helps maintain normal growth rates, normal skin hydration and senses of taste and smell. Providing zinc during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms: parakeratosis, hypogeusia, anorexia, dysosmia, geophagia, hypogonadism, growth retardation and hepatosplenomegaly. At plasma levels below 20 mcg zinc/100 mL, dermatitis followed by alopecia has been reported for TPN patients. COPPER is essential as a cofactor for serum ceruloplasmin, an oxidase necessary for proper formation of the iron carrier protein, transferrin. Copper also helps maintain normal rates of red and white blood cell formation. Scorbutic type bone changes seen in infants fed exclusively with copper-poor cow's milk are believed due to decreased activity of ascorbate oxidase, a cuproenzyme. Providing copper during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms: leukopenia, neutropenia, anemia, depressed ceruloplasmin levels, impaired transferrin formation and secondary iron deficiency. MANGANESE is an activator for enzymes such as polysaccharide polymerase, liver arginase, cholinesterase and pyruvate carboxylase. Providing manganese during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms: nausea and vomiting, weight loss, dermatitis, and changes in growth and color of hair. CHROMIUM (trivalent) is part of glucose tolerance factor, an activator of insulin-mediated reactions. Chromium helps to maintain normal glucose metabolism and peripheral nerve function. Providing chromium during TPN prevents development of the following deficiency symptoms: impaired glucose tolerance, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and a confusional state similar to mild/moderate hepatic encephalopathy. SELENIUM is part of glutathione peroxidase which protects cell components from oxidative damage due to peroxides produced in cellular metabolism. Prolonged TPN support in humans has resulted in selenium deficiency symptoms which include muscle pain and tenderness. The symptoms have been reported to respond to supplementation of TPN solutions with selenium."

    "indications_and_usage": [
      "INDICATIONS AND USAGE This formulation is indicated for use as a supplement to intravenous solutions given for TPN. Administration of the solution in TPN solutions helps to maintain plasma levels of zinc, copper, manganese, selenium and chromium and to prevent depletion of endogenous stores of these trace elements and subsequent deficiency symptoms."

    "contraindications": [
      "CONTRAINDICATIONS MULTITRACE \u00ae - 5 should not be given undiluted by direct injection into a peripheral vein because of the potential of infusion phlebitis."
    ],
    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Copper and Manganese are eliminated via the bile. In patients with severe liver dysfunction and/or biliary tract obstruction, decreasing or omitting copper and manganese supplements entirely may be necessary. This product contains aluminum that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum at levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS Before administering MULTITRACE \u00ae - 5 in TPN solutions, the physician must assess the metabolic requirements for trace elements and disease state of the patient. Frequent determinations of serum levels of the various trace elements are suggested as a guideline for adjusting the dosage or completely omitting the solution. ZINC is eliminated via the intestine and kidneys. The possibility of retention should be considered in patients with malfunctioning excretory routes. COPPER and MANGANESE are eliminated via the bile, therefore the possibility of retention of these elements should be considered in patients with biliary obstruction. Ancillary routes of MANGANESE excretion, however, include pancreatic juice, or reabsorption into the lumen of duodenum, jejunum, or ileum. In assessing the contribution of CHROMIUM supplements to maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis, consideration should be given to the possibility that the patient may be diabetic, in which case oral or intravenous antidiabetic medication may be indicated. As SELENIUM is eliminated in urine and feces, SELENIUM supplements may be adjusted, reduced or omitted in renal dysfunction and/or gastrointestinal malfunction. In patients receiving blood transfusions, contribution from such transfusions should also be considered. Frequent selenium plasma level determinations are suggested as a guideline. In animals, SELENIUM has been reported to enhance the action of Vitamin E and decrease the toxicity of mercury, cadmium, and arsenic. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C: SELENIUM at high dosage levels (15-30 mcg/egg) has been reported to have adverse embryological effects among chickens. There are however no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women. MULTITRACE \u00ae - 5 should be used during pregnancy only if potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Presence of SELENIUM in placenta and umbilical cord blood has been reported in humans."

    ],
    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Symptoms of ZINC overdosage resulting from oral ingestion of Zinc Sulfate in large amounts have resulted in death. Symptoms included nausea, vomiting, dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, dizziness, abdominal pain, lethargy and incoordination. Single intravenous doses of 1 to 2 mg zinc/kg body weight have been given to adult leukemic patients without toxic manifestations. Normal plasma levels for Zinc vary from approximately 88 to 112 mcg/100 mL. Plasma levels sufficient to produce symptoms of toxic manifestations are not known. Calcium supplements may confer a protective effect against Zinc toxicity. Symptoms of COPPER toxicity reported in literature include prostration, behavior change, diarrhea, progressive marasmus, hypotonia, photophobia and peripheral edema. D-penicillamine has been reported effective as an antidote. MANGANESE toxicity has not been reported in patients receiving TPN. Neither have reports of manganese toxicity from excessive intake in foods and/or beverages been published. Symptoms of CHROMIUM toxicity include nausea, vomiting, ulcers of gastrointestinal tract, renal and hepatic damage, and abnormalities of the central nervous system culminating in convulsions and coma. Trivalent Chromium administered intravenously to TPN patients has been shown to be nontoxic when given at dosage levels up to 250 mcg/day for two consecutive weeks. Chronic toxicity in humans resulting from exposure to SELENIUM in industrial environments, intake of foods grown in seleniferous soils, use of selenium contaminated water, and application of cosmetics containing selenium has been reported in literature. Toxicity symptoms include hair loss, weakened nails, dermatitis, dental defects, gastrointestinal disorders, nervousness, mental depression, metallic taste, vomiting, and garlic odor of breath and sweat. Acute poisoning due to ingestion of large amounts of selenium compounds has resulted in death with histopathological changes including fulminating peripheral vascular collapse, internal vascular congestion, diffusely hemorrhagic, congested and edematous lungs, brick-red color gastric mucosa. The death was preceded by coma. No effective antidote to selenium poisoning in humans is known. Animal studies have shown casein and linseed oil in feeds, reduced glutathione, arsenic, magnesium sulfate, and bromobenzene to afford limited protection."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Each mL of the solution provides Zinc 1 mg, Copper 0.4 mg, Manganese 0.1 mg, Chromium 4 mcg, and Selenium 20 mcg. The suggested dosage ranges for the five trace elements are: ZINC : For the metabolically stable adult receiving TPN, the suggested intravenous dosage level is 2.5 to 4 mg zinc/day. An additional 2 mg zinc/day is suggested for acute catabolic states. For the stable adult with fluid loss from the small bowel, an additional 12.2 mg zinc/liter of small bowel fluid lost, or an additional 17.1 mg zinc/kg of stool or ileostomy output is recommended. Frequent monitoring of zinc blood levels is suggested for patients receiving more than the usual maintenance dosage level of zinc. Normal plasma levels for zinc vary from approximately 88 to 112 mcg/100 mL. For full term infants and children up to 5 years of age, 100 mcg zinc/kg/day is recommended. For premature infants (birth weight less than 1500 g) up to 3 kg in body weight, 300 mcg zinc/kg/day is suggested. COPPER : For the metabolically stable adult receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage level is 0.5 to 1.5 mg copper/day. For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage level is 20 mcg copper/kg/day. The normal plasma range for copper is approximately 80 to 160 mcg/100 mL. MANGANESE : For the metabolically stable adult receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage level for manganese is 0.15 mg to 0.8 mg/day. For pediatric patients, a dosage level of 2 to 10 mcg manganese/kg/day is recommended. CHROMIUM : For the metabolically stable adult receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage level is 10 to 15 mcg chromium/day. The metabolically stable adult with intestinal fluid loss may require 20 mcg chromium/day, with frequent monitoring of blood levels as a guideline for subsequent administration. For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage level is 0.14 to 0.20 mcg/kg/day. SELENIUM : For metabolically stable adults receiving TPN, the suggested additive dosage level is 20 to 40 mcg selenium/day. For pediatric patients, the suggested additive dosage level is 3 mcg/kg/day. In adults, selenium deficiency states resulting from long term TPN support, selenium as selenomethionine or selenious acid, administered intravenously at 100 mcg/day for a period of 24 and 31 days, respectively, has been reported to reverse deficiency symptoms without toxicity. The normal whole blood range for selenium is approximately 10 to 37 mcg/100 mL. Periodic monitoring of plasma levels of Zinc, Copper, Manganese, Chromium and Selenium is suggested as a guideline for administration. Aseptic addition of MULTITRACE \u00ae - 5 to parenteral nutrition solutions under laminar flow hood is recommended. The trace elements present in MULTITRACE \u00ae - 5 are physically compatible with the electrolytes and vitamins usually present in parenteral nutrition formulations. Do not directly mix ascorbic acid injection with copper or selenium containing parenteral products in the same syringe or vial, as this admixture may cause the formation of an insoluble precipitate. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Store at 20\u00b0 to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F); excursions permitted to 15\u00b0 to 30\u00b0C (59\u00b0 to 86\u00b0F) (See USP Controlled Room Temperature)."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY The most widely accepted mechanism of action of sulfonamides is the woods-fields theory which is based on the fact that sulfonamides act as competitive antagonists to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth. While absorption through intact skin has not been determined, sodium sulfacetamide is readily absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract when taken orally and excreted in the urine, largely unchanged. The biological half-life has variously been reported as 7 to 12.8 hours. The exact mode of action of sulfur in the treatment of acne is unknown but it has been reported that it inhibits the growth of propionibacterium acnes and the formation of free fatty acids."

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch 5% performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours. Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value <0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Risk of Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue lidocaine patch 5% and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen. Accidental Exposure in Children Even a used lidocaine patch 5% contains a large amount of lidocaine (at least 665 mg). The potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used lidocaine patch 5%, although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated. It is important for patients to store and dispose of lidocaine patch 5% out of the reach of children, pets, and others (see HANDLING AND DISPOSAL). Excessive Dosing Excessive dosing by applying lidocaine patch 5% to larger areas or for longer than the recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood concentrations, leading to serious adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions). Lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 mcg/mL. The blood concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination. Longer duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller patients, or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of lidocaine. With recommended dosing of lidocaine patch 5%, the average peak blood concentration is about 0.13 mcg/mL, but concentrations higher than 0.25 mcg/mL have been observed in some individuals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hepatic Disease Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally. Allergic Reactions Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. However, lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain. Non-intact Skin Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption. Lidocaine patch 5% is only recommended for use on intact skin. External Heat Sources Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over lidocaine patch 5% is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma lidocaine levels. Eye Exposure The contact of lidocaine patch 5% with eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns. Information for Patients Methemoglobinemia Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue. Drug Interactions Antiarrhythmic Drugs Lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Local Anesthetics When lidocaine patch 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered. Drugs That May Cause Methemoglobinemia When Used with Lidocaine Patch 5% Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics: Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitric oxide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, tetracaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid, sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants Phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, quinine, sulfasalazine Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Mutagenesis Lidocaine HCl is not mutagenic in Salmonella/mammalian microsome test nor clastogenic in chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes and mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effect of lidocaine patch 5% on fertility has not been studied. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in pregnancy. Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, lidocaine patch 5% should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in labor and delivery. Lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should lidocaine patch 5% be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered. Nursing Mothers Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in nursing mothers. Lidocaine is excreted in human milk, and the milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4. Caution should be exercised when lidocaine patch 5% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Application Site Reactions During or immediately after treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, the skin at the site of application may develop blisters, bruising, burning sensation, depigmentation, dermatitis, discoloration, edema, erythema, exfoliation, irritation, papules, petechia, pruritus, vesicles, or may be the locus of abnormal sensation. These reactions are generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within a few minutes to hours. Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm, pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Other Adverse Events Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including: Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence, taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and tremor. Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine patch 5% are unlikely, due to the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold, or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE Lidocaine overdose from cutaneous absorption is rare, but could occur. If there is any suspicion of lidocaine overdose (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions), drug blood concentration should be checked. The management of overdose includes close monitoring, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdose with lidocaine. In the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion, evaluation of symptoms of toxicity should include consideration of other etiologies for the clinical effects, or overdosage from other sources of lidocaine or other local anesthetics. The oral LD 50 of lidocaine HCl is 459 (346 to 773) mg/kg (as the salt) in non-fasted female rats and 214 (159 to 324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats, which are equivalent to roughly 4000 mg and 2000 mg, respectively, in a 60 to 70 kg man based on the equivalent surface area dosage conversion factors between species."

      "DESCRIPTION: Magnesium Sulfate in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP is a sterile, nonpyrogenic solution of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose in water for injection. Each 100 mL contains 1 g magnesium sulfate heptahydrate and dextrose, hydrous 5 g in water for injection. May contain sulfuric acid and/or sodium hydroxide for pH adjustment. The pH is 4.5 (3.5 to 6.5). It is available in a 1% concentration. See HOW SUPPLIED section for the content and characteristics of available dosage form and size. Magnesium sulfate, USP heptahydrate is chemically designated MgSO 4 \u2022 7H 2 O, colorless crystals or white powder freely soluble in water. Dextrose, USP is chemically designated D-glucose, monohydrate, a hexose sugar freely soluble in water. It has the following structural formula: C 6 H 12 O 6 \u2022 H 2 O M.W. 198.17 Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H 2 O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers ( free flex \u00ae bag). The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container\u2019s chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. Exposure to temperatures above 25\u00baC/77\u00baF during transport and storage will lead to minor losses in moisture content. Higher temperatures lead to greater losses. It is unlikely that these minor losses will lead to clinically significant changes within the expiration period. structure"

    "clinical_pharmacology": [
      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Magnesium (Mg ++ ) is an important cofactor for enzymatic reactions and plays an important role in neurochemical transmission and muscular excitability. Magnesium prevents or controls convulsions by blocking neuromuscular transmission and decreasing the amount of acetylcholine liberated at the end plate by the motor nerve impulse. Magnesium is said to have a depressant effect on the central nervous system, but it does not adversely affect the mother, fetus or neonate when used as directed in eclampsia or pre-eclampsia. Normal serum magnesium levels range from 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/liter. As serum magnesium rises above 4 mEq/liter, the deep tendon reflexes are first decreased and then disappear as the serum level approaches 10 mEq/liter. At this level respiratory paralysis may occur. Heart block also may occur at this or lower serum levels of magnesium. Magnesium acts peripherally to produce vasodilation. With low doses only flushing and sweating occur, but larger doses cause lowering of blood pressure. The central and peripheral effects of magnesium poisoning are antagonized to some extent by intravenous administration of calcium. With intravenous administration the onset of anticonvulsant action is immediate and lasts about 30 minutes. Following intramuscular administration the onset of action occurs in about one hour and persists for three to four hours. Effective anticonvulsant serum levels range from 2.5 to 7.5 mEq/liter. Pharmacokinetics Absorption Intravenously administered magnesium is immediately absorbed. Distribution Approximately 1 to 2% of total body magnesium is located in the extracellular fluid space. Magnesium is 30% bound to albumin. Metabolism Magnesium is not metabolized. Excretion Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney at a rate proportional to the serum concentration and glomerular filtration. Special Populations Renal Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. In patients with severe renal insufficiency, the dose should be lower and frequent serum magnesium levels must be obtained (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Hepatic Insufficiency Magnesium is excreted solely by the kidney. No dosing adjustments are necessary in hepatic insufficiency. Drug-Drug Interactions Drug induced renal losses of magnesium occur with the following drugs or drug classes: Aminoglycosides Amphotericin B Cyclosporine Diuretics Digitalis Cisplatin Alcohol",

      "WARNINGS: FETAL HARM: Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days to pregnant women can lead to hypocalcemia and bone abnormalities in the developing fetus. These bone abnormalities include skeletal demineralization and osteopenia. In addition, cases of neonatal fracture have been reported. The shortest duration of treatment that can lead to fetal harm is not known. Magnesium sulfate should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. If magnesium sulfate is given for treatment of preterm labor, the woman should be informed that the efficacy and safety of such use have not been established and that use of magnesium sulfate beyond 5 to 7 days may cause fetal abnormalities. Parenteral use in the presence of renal insufficiency may lead to magnesium intoxication."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS: Because magnesium is removed from the body solely by the kidneys, the drug should be used with caution in patients with renal impairment. Urine output should be maintained at a level of 100 mL every four hours. Monitoring serum magnesium levels and the patient\u2019s clinical status is essential to avoid the consequences of overdosage in toxemia. Clinical indications of a safe dosage regimen include the presence of the patellar reflex (knee jerk) and absence of respiratory depression (approximately 16 breaths or more/minute). Serum magnesium levels usually sufficient to control convulsions range from 3 to 6 mg/100 mL (2.5 to 5 mEq/liter). The strength of the deep tendon reflexes begins to diminish when serum magnesium levels exceed 4 mEq/liter. Reflexes may be absent at 10 mEq magnesium/liter, where respiratory paralysis is a potential hazard. An injectable calcium salt should be immediately available to counteract the potential hazards of magnesium intoxication in eclampsia. Magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP should be administered slowly to avoid producing hypermagnesemia. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Studies with magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP have not been performed to evaluate carcinogenic potential, mutagenic potential or effects on fertility. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category D (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS ) See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS .

If this drug is used during pregnancy the woman should be apprised of the potential harm to the fetus. Nonteratogenic Effects When administered by continuous IV infusion (especially for more than 24 hours preceding delivery) to control convulsions in a toxemic woman, the newborn may show signs of magnesium toxicity, including neuromuscular or respiratory depression (see OVERDOSAGE ). Labor and Delivery Continuous administration of magnesium sulfate is an unapproved treatment for preterm labor. The safety and efficacy of such use have not been established. The administration of magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP outside of its approved indication in pregnant women should be by trained obstetrical personnel in a hospital setting with appropriate obstetrical care facilities.

These include flushing, sweating, hypotension, depressed reflexes, flaccid paralysis, hypothermia, circulatory collapse, cardiac and central nervous system depression proceeding to respiratory paralysis. Hypocalcemia with signs of tetany secondary to magnesium sulfate therapy for eclampsia has been reported."

    "overdosage": [
      "OVERDOSAGE: Magnesium intoxication is manifested by a sharp drop in blood pressure and respiratory paralysis. Disappearance of the patellar reflex is a useful clinical sign to detect the onset of magnesium intoxication. In the event of overdosage, artificial ventilation must be provided until a calcium salt can be injected IV to antagonize the effects of magnesium. For Treatment of Overdose Artificial respiration is often required. Intravenous calcium, 10 to 20 mL of a 5% solution (diluted if desirable) with isotonic sodium chloride for injection) is used to counteract effects of hypermagnesemia. Subcutaneous physostigmine, 0.5 to 1 mg may be helpful. Hypermagnesemia in the newborn may require resuscitation and assisted ventilation via endotracheal intubation or intermittent positive pressure ventilation as well as IV calcium.",

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP is intended for intravenous use only. For the management of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, intravenous infusions of dilute solutions of magnesium (1% to 8%) are often given in combination with intramuscular injections of 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. Therefore, in the clinical conditions cited below, both forms of therapy are noted, as appropriate. Continuous maternal administration of magnesium sulfate in pregnancy beyond 5 to 7 days can cause fetal abnormalities. In Pre-eclampsia or Eclampsia In severe pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, the total initial dose is 10 to 14 g of magnesium sulfate. To initiate therapy, 4 g of magnesium sulfate in 5% dextrose injection, USP may be administered intravenously. The rate of IV infusion should generally not exceed 150 mg/minute, or 7.5 mL of a 2% concentration (or its equivalent) per minute, except in severe eclampsia with seizures. Simultaneously, 4 to 5 g (32.5 to 40.6 mEq) of magnesium sulfate may be administered intramuscularly into each buttock using undiluted 50% magnesium sulfate injection, USP. After the initial IV dose, some clinicians administer 1 to 2 g/hour by constant IV infusion. Subsequent intramuscular doses of 4 to 5 g of magnesium sulfate may be injected into alternate buttocks every four hours, depending on the continuing presence of the patellar reflex, adequate respiratory function, and absence of signs of magnesium toxicity. Therapy should continue until paroxysms cease. A serum magnesium level of 6 mg/100 mL is considered optimal for control of seizures. A total daily (24 hr) dose of 30 to 40 g magnesium sulfate should not be exceeded. In the presence of severe renal insufficiency, frequent serum magnesium concentrations must be obtained, and the maximum recommended dosage of magnesium sulfate is 20 g per 48 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer unless solution is clear. Discard unused portion.",

      "DESCRIPTION Lidocaine patch 5% is comprised of an adhesive material containing 5% lidocaine, which is applied to a non-woven polyester felt backing and covered with a polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film release liner. The release liner is removed prior to application to the skin. The size of the patch is 10 cm x 14 cm. Lidocaine is chemically designated as acetamide, 2-(diethylamino)-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl), has an octanol:water partition ratio of 43 at pH 7.4, and has the following structure: Each adhesive patch contains 700 mg of lidocaine (50 mg per gram adhesive) in an aqueous base. It also contains the following inactive ingredients: purified water, glycerin, sorbitol, polyacrylic acid, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sodium polyacrylate, propylene glycol, urea, kaolin, tartaric acid, gelatin, polyvinyl alcohol, dihydroxyaluminum aminoacetate, edetate disodium, methylparaben, and propylparaben. molecule"

      "CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY Pharmacodynamics Lidocaine is an amide-type local anesthetic agent and is suggested to stabilize neuronal membranes by inhibiting the ionic fluxes required for the initiation and conduction of impulses. The penetration of lidocaine into intact skin after application of a lidocaine patch 5% is sufficient to produce an analgesic effect, but less than the amount necessary to produce a complete sensory block. Pharmacokinetics Absorption The amount of lidocaine systemically absorbed from lidocaine patch 5% is directly related to both the duration of application and the surface area over which it is applied. In a pharmacokinetic study, three lidocaine patches were applied over an area of 420 cm 2 of intact skin on the back of normal volunteers for 12 hours. Blood samples were withdrawn for determination of lidocaine concentration during the application and for 12 hours after removal of patches. The results are summarized in Table 1. Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

Table 1 Absorption of lidocaine from Lidocaine Patch 5% Normal volunteers (n=15, 12-hour wearing time) Lidocaine Patch 5% Application Site Area (cm 2 ) Dose Absorbed (mg) C max (mcg/mL) T max (hr) 3 patches (2100 mg) Back 420 64 \u00b1 32 0.13 \u00b1 0.06 11 hr When lidocaine patch 5% is used according to the recommended dosing instructions, only 3 \u00b1 2% of the dose applied is expected to be absorbed. At least 95% (665 mg) of lidocaine will remain in a used patch. Mean peak blood concentration of lidocaine is about 0.13 mcg/mL (about 1/10 of the therapeutic concentration required to treat cardiac arrhythmias). Repeated application of three patches simultaneously for 12 hours (recommended maximum daily dose), once per day for three days, indicated that the lidocaine concentration does not increase with daily use. The mean plasma pharmacokinetic profile for the 15 healthy volunteers is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Mean lidocaine blood concentrations after three consecutive daily applications of three lidocaine patches simultaneously for 12 hours per day in healthy volunteers (n = 15). Distribution When lidocaine is administered intravenously to healthy volunteers, the volume of distribution is 0.7 to 2.7 L/kg (mean 1.5 \u00b1 0.6 SD, n = 15). At concentrations produced by application of lidocaine patch 5%, lidocaine is approximately 70% bound to plasma proteins, primarily alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. At much higher plasma concentrations (1 to 4 mcg/mL of free base), the plasma protein binding of lidocaine is concentration dependent. Lidocaine crosses the placental and blood brain barriers, presumably by passive diffusion. Metabolism It is not known if lidocaine is metabolized in the skin. Lidocaine is metabolized rapidly by the liver to a number of metabolites, including monoethylglycinexylidide (MEGX) and glycinexylidide (GX), both of which have pharmacologic activity similar to, but less potent than that of lidocaine. A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has unknown pharmacologic activity but is carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Following intravenous administration, MEGX and GX concentrations in serum range from 11 to 36% and from 5 to 11% of lidocaine concentrations, respectively. Excretion Lidocaine and its metabolites are excreted by the kidneys. Less than 10% of lidocaine is excreted unchanged. The half-life of lidocaine elimination from the plasma following IV administration is 81 to 149 minutes (mean 107 \u00b1 22 SD, n = 15). The systemic clearance is 0.33 to 0.90 L/min (mean 0.64 \u00b1 0.18 SD, n = 15). graphs"

      "CLINICAL STUDIES Single-dose treatment with lidocaine patch 5% was compared to treatment with vehicle patch (without lidocaine), and to no treatment (observation only) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial with 35 post-herpetic neuralgia patients. Pain intensity and pain relief scores were evaluated periodically for 12 hours. Lidocaine patch 5% performed statistically better than vehicle patch in terms of pain intensity from 4 to 12 hours. Multiple-dose, two-week treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, was compared to vehicle patch (without lidocaine) in a double-blind, crossover clinical trial of withdrawal-type design conducted in 32 patients, who were considered as responders to the open-label use of lidocaine patch 5% prior to the study. The constant type of pain was evaluated but not the pain induced by sensory stimuli (dysesthesia). Statistically significant differences favoring lidocaine patch 5% were observed in terms of time to exit from the trial (14 versus 3.8 days at p-value <0.001), daily average pain relief, and patient's preference of treatment. About half of the patients also took oral medication commonly used in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The extent of use of concomitant medication was similar in the two treatment groups."

    "warnings": [
      "WARNINGS Risk of Methemoglobinemia Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in association with local anesthetic use. Although all patients are at risk for methemoglobinemia, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, infants under 6 months of age, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. If local anesthetics must be used in these patients, close monitoring for symptoms and signs of methemoglobinemia is recommended. Signs of methemoglobinemia may occur immediately or may be delayed some hours after exposure, and are characterized by a cyanotic skin discoloration and/or abnormal coloration of the blood. Methemoglobin levels may continue to rise; therefore, immediate treatment is required to avert more serious central nervous system and cardiovascular adverse effects, including seizures, coma, arrhythmias, and death. Discontinue lidocaine patch 5% and any other oxidizing agents. Depending on the severity of the signs and symptoms, patients may respond to supportive care, i.e., oxygen therapy, hydration. A more severe clinical presentation may require treatment with methylene blue, exchange transfusion, or hyperbaric oxygen. Accidental Exposure in Children Even a used lidocaine patch 5% contains a large amount of lidocaine (at least 665 mg). The potential exists for a small child or a pet to suffer serious adverse effects from chewing or ingesting a new or used lidocaine patch 5%, although the risk with this formulation has not been evaluated. It is important for patients to store and dispose of lidocaine patch 5% out of the reach of children, pets, and others (see HANDLING AND DISPOSAL). Excessive Dosing Excessive dosing by applying lidocaine patch 5% to larger areas or for longer than the recommended wearing time could result in increased absorption of lidocaine and high blood concentrations, leading to serious adverse effects (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions). Lidocaine toxicity could be expected at lidocaine blood concentrations above 5 mcg/mL. The blood concentration of lidocaine is determined by the rate of systemic absorption and elimination. Longer duration of application, application of more than the recommended number of patches, smaller patients, or impaired elimination may all contribute to increasing the blood concentration of lidocaine. With recommended dosing of lidocaine patch 5%, the average peak blood concentration is about 0.13 mcg/mL, but concentrations higher than 0.25 mcg/mL have been observed in some individuals."
    ],
    "precautions": [
      "PRECAUTIONS General Hepatic Disease Patients with severe hepatic disease are at greater risk of developing toxic blood concentrations of lidocaine, because of their inability to metabolize lidocaine normally. Allergic Reactions Patients allergic to para-aminobenzoic acid derivatives (procaine, tetracaine, benzocaine, etc.) have not shown cross sensitivity to lidocaine. However, lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients with a history of drug sensitivities, especially if the etiologic agent is uncertain. Non-intact Skin Application to broken or inflamed skin, although not tested, may result in higher blood concentrations of lidocaine from increased absorption. Lidocaine patch 5% is only recommended for use on intact skin. External Heat Sources Placement of external heat sources, such as heating pads or electric blankets, over lidocaine patch 5% is not recommended as this has not been evaluated and may increase plasma lidocaine levels. Eye Exposure The contact of lidocaine patch 5% with eyes, although not studied, should be avoided based on the findings of severe eye irritation with the use of similar products in animals. If eye contact occurs, immediately wash out the eye with water or saline and protect the eye until sensation returns. Information for Patients Methemoglobinemia Inform patients that use of local anesthetics may cause methemoglobinemia, a serious condition that must be treated promptly. Advise patients or caregivers to stop use and seek immediate medical attention if they or someone in their care experience the following signs or symptoms: pale, gray, or blue colored skin (cyanosis); headache; rapid heart rate; shortness of breath; lightheadedness; or fatigue. Drug Interactions Antiarrhythmic Drugs Lidocaine patch 5% should be used with caution in patients receiving Class I antiarrhythmic drugs (such as tocainide and mexiletine) since the toxic effects are additive and potentially synergistic. Local Anesthetics When lidocaine patch 5% is used concomitantly with other products containing local anesthetic agents, the amount absorbed from all formulations must be considered. Drugs That May Cause Methemoglobinemia When Used with Lidocaine Patch 5% Patients who are administered local anesthetics are at increased risk of developing methemoglobinemia when concurrently exposed to the following drugs, which could include other local anesthetics: Examples of Drugs Associated with Methemoglobinemia: Class Examples Nitrates/Nitrites nitric oxide, nitroglycerin, nitroprusside, nitrous oxide Local anesthetics articaine, benzocaine, bupivacaine, lidocaine, mepivacaine, prilocaine, procaine, ropivacaine, tetracaine Antineoplastic agents cyclophosphamide, flutamide, hydroxyurea, ifosfamide, rasburicase Antibiotics dapsone, nitrofurantoin, para-aminosalicylic acid, sulfonamides Antimalarials chloroquine, primaquine Anticonvulsants Phenobarbital, phenytoin, sodium valproate Other drugs acetaminophen, metoclopramide, quinine, sulfasalazine Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenesis A minor metabolite, 2,6-xylidine, has been found to be carcinogenic in rats. The blood concentration of this metabolite is negligible following application of lidocaine patch 5%. Mutagenesis Lidocaine HCl is not mutagenic in Salmonella/mammalian microsome test nor clastogenic in chromosome aberration assay with human lymphocytes and mouse micronucleus test. Impairment of Fertility The effect of lidocaine patch 5% on fertility has not been studied. Pregnancy Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category B. Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in pregnancy. Reproduction studies with lidocaine have been performed in rats at doses up to 30 mg/kg subcutaneously and have revealed no evidence of harm to the fetus due to lidocaine. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, lidocaine patch 5% should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Labor and Delivery Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in labor and delivery. Lidocaine is not contraindicated in labor and delivery. Should lidocaine patch 5% be used concomitantly with other products containing lidocaine, total doses contributed by all formulations must be considered. Nursing Mothers Lidocaine patch 5% has not been studied in nursing mothers. Lidocaine is excreted in human milk, and the milk:plasma ratio of lidocaine is 0.4. Caution should be exercised when lidocaine patch 5% is administered to a nursing woman. Pediatric Use Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established."

      "ADVERSE REACTIONS Application Site Reactions During or immediately after treatment with lidocaine patch 5%, the skin at the site of application may develop blisters, bruising, burning sensation, depigmentation, dermatitis, discoloration, edema, erythema, exfoliation, irritation, papules, petechia, pruritus, vesicles, or may be the locus of abnormal sensation. These reactions are generally mild and transient, resolving spontaneously within a few minutes to hours. Allergic Reactions Allergic and anaphylactoid reactions associated with lidocaine, although rare, can occur. They are characterized by angioedema, bronchospasm, dermatitis, dyspnea, hypersensitivity, laryngospasm, pruritus, shock, and urticaria. If they occur, they should be managed by conventional means. The detection of sensitivity by skin testing is of doubtful value. Other Adverse Events Due to the nature and limitation of spontaneous reports in postmarketing surveillance, causality has not been established for additional reported adverse events including: Asthenia, confusion, disorientation, dizziness, headache, hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, lightheadedness, metallic taste, nausea, nervousness, pain exacerbated, paresthesia, somnolence, taste alteration, vomiting, visual disturbances such as blurred vision, flushing, tinnitus, and tremor. Systemic (Dose-Related) Reactions Systemic adverse reactions following appropriate use of lidocaine patch 5% are unlikely, due to the small dose absorbed (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Pharmacokinetics). Systemic adverse effects of lidocaine are similar in nature to those observed with other amide local anesthetic agents, including CNS excitation and/or depression (lightheadedness, nervousness, apprehension, euphoria, confusion, dizziness, drowsiness, tinnitus, blurred or double vision, vomiting, sensations of heat, cold, or numbness, twitching, tremors, convulsions, unconsciousness, respiratory depression and arrest). Excitatory CNS reactions may be brief or not occur at all, in which case the first manifestation may be drowsiness merging into unconsciousness. Cardiovascular manifestations may include bradycardia, hypotension, and cardiovascular collapse leading to arrest."

    "overdosage": [

If there is any suspicion of lidocaine overdose (see ADVERSE REACTIONS, Systemic Reactions), drug blood concentration should be checked. The management of overdose includes close monitoring, supportive care, and symptomatic treatment. Dialysis is of negligible value in the treatment of acute overdose with lidocaine. In the absence of massive topical overdose or oral ingestion, evaluation of symptoms of toxicity should include consideration of other etiologies for the clinical effects, or overdosage from other sources of lidocaine or other local anesthetics. The oral LD 50 of lidocaine HCl is 459 (346 to 773) mg/kg (as the salt) in non-fasted female rats and 214 (159 to 324) mg/kg (as the salt) in fasted female rats, which are equivalent to roughly 4000 mg and 2000 mg, respectively, in a 60 to 70 kg man based on the equivalent surface area dosage conversion factors between species."
