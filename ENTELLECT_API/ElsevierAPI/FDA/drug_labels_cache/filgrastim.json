      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy for AML Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection, short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or continuous intravenous infusion. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.1 ) Patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation: 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.2 ) Patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.3 ) Administer for at least 4 days before first leukapheresis procedure and continue until last leukapheresis ( 2.3 ) Patients with congenital neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 6 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection twice daily ( 2.4 ) Patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection daily ( 2.4 ) Patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.5 ) Direct administration of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to potential for dosing errors ( 2.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy or Induction and/or Consolidation Chemotherapy for AML The recommended starting dosage of NYPOZI is 5 mcg/kg/day\u201a administered as a single daily injection by subcutaneous injection, by short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or by continuous intravenous infusion. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count before instituting NYPOZI therapy and monitor twice weekly during therapy. Consider dose escalation in increments of 5 mcg/kg for each chemotherapy cycle\u201a according to the duration and severity of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir. Recommend stopping NYPOZI if the ANC increases beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Administer NYPOZI at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Do not administer NYPOZI within the 24-hour period prior to chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A transient increase in neutrophil count is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of filgrastim therapy. Therefore, to ensure a sustained therapeutic response\u201a administer NYPOZI daily for up to 2 weeks or until the ANC has reached 10\u201a000/mm 3 following the expected chemotherapy-induced neutrophil nadir. The duration of NYPOZI therapy needed to attenuate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may be dependent on the myelosuppressive potential of the chemotherapy regimen employed. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The recommended dosage of NYPOZI following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. Administer the first dose of NYPOZI at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after bone marrow infusion. Monitor CBCs and platelet counts frequently following marrow transplantation. During the period of neutrophil recovery\u201a titrate the daily dosage of NYPOZI against the neutrophil response (see Table 1). Table 1. Recommended Dosage Adjustments During Neutrophil Recovery in Patients with Cancer Following BMT Absolute Neutrophil Count NYPOZI Dosage Adjustment a If ANC decreases to less than 1000/mm 3 at any time during the 5 mcg/kg/day administration\u201a increase NYPOZI to 10 mcg/kg/day\u201a and then follow the above steps. When ANC greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days Reduce to 5 mcg/kg/day a Then, if ANC remains greater than 1,000/ mm 3 for 3 more consecutive days Discontinue NYPOZI Then, if ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 Resume at 5 mcg/kg/day 2.3 Dosage in Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The recommended dosage of NYPOZI for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg/kg/day given by subcutaneous injection. Administer NYPOZI for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continue until the last leukapheresis. Although the optimal duration of NYPOZI administration and leukapheresis schedule have not been established\u201a administration of filgrastim for 6 to 7 days with leukaphereses on days 5\u201a 6\u201a and 7 was found to be safe and effective [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Monitor neutrophil counts after 4 days of NYPOZI and discontinue NYPOZI if the white blood cell (WBC) count rises to greater than 100\u201a000/mm 3. 2.4 Dosage in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Prior to starting NYPOZI in patients with suspected chronic neutropenia, confirm the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) by evaluating serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts\u201a and evaluating bone marrow morphology and karyotype. The use of NYPOZI prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of SCN may impair diagnostic efforts and may thus impair or delay evaluation and treatment of an underlying condition\u201a other than SCN\u201a causing the neutropenia. The recommended starting dosage in patients with Congenital Neutropenia is 6 mcg/kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection and the recommended starting dosage in patients with Idiopathic or Cyclic Neutropenia is 5 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection. Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Chronic daily administration is required to maintain clinical benefit. Individualize the dosage based on the patient's clinical course as well as ANC. In the SCN postmarketing surveillance study, the reported median daily doses of filgrastim were: 6 mcg/kg (congenital neutropenia), 2.1 mcg/kg (cyclic neutropenia), and 1.2 mcg/kg (idiopathic neutropenia). In rare instances, patients with congenital neutropenia have required doses of filgrastim greater than or equal to 100 mcg/kg/day. Monitor CBCs for Dosage Adjustments During the initial 4 weeks of NYPOZI therapy and during the 2 weeks following any dosage adjustment\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts. Once a patient is clinically stable\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts monthly during the first year of treatment. Thereafter, if the patient is clinically stable, less frequent routine monitoring is recommended. 2.5 Dosage in Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) The recommended dose of NYPOZI is 10 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection for patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Administer NYPOZI as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation doses greater than 2 gray (Gy). Estimate a patient's absorbed radiation dose (i.e., level of radiation exposure) based on information from public health authorities, biodosimetry if available, or clinical findings such as time to onset of vomiting or lymphocyte depletion kinetics. Obtain a baseline CBC and then serial CBCs approximately every third day until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs. Do not delay administration of NYPOZI if a CBC is not readily available. Continue administration of NYPOZI until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs or exceeds 10,000/mm 3 after a radiation-induced nadir. 2.6 Important Administration Instructions NYPOZI is supplied in single-dose prefilled syringes (for subcutaneous or intravenous use) [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ] . Prior to use\u201a remove the prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow NYPOZI to reach room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 24 hours. Discard any prefilled syringe left at room temperature for greater than 24 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer NYPOZI if particulates or discoloration are observed. Discard unused portion of NYPOZI in prefilled syringes. Do not save unused drug for later administration. Subcutaneous Injection Inject NYPOZI subcutaneously in the outer area of upper arms, abdomen, thighs, or upper outer areas of the buttock. If patients or caregivers are to administer NYPOZI, instruct them in appropriate injection technique and ask them to follow the subcutaneous injection procedures in the Instructions for Use for the prefilled syringe [see Patient Counseling Information (17 )]. Training by a healthcare professional should aim to demonstrate to those patients and caregivers how to measure the dose using the prefilled syringe, and the focus should be on ensuring that a patient or caregiver can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use for the NYPOZI prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive\u2122 Needle Guard. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of NYPOZI. NYPOZI prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive\u2122 Needle Guard is not designed to allow for direct administration of doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg). The spring-mechanism of the needle guard apparatus affixed to the prefilled syringe interferes with the visibility of the graduation markings on the syringe barrel corresponding to 0.1 mL and 0.2 mL. The visibility of these markings is necessary to accurately measure doses of NYPOZI less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) for direct administration to patients. Thus, the direct administration to patients requiring doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. Dilution If required for intravenous administration, NYPOZI may be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection to a concentration of 15 mcg/mL. NYPOZI diluted to 15 mcg/mL should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by the addition of Albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. When diluted in 5% Dextrose plus Albumin (Human), NYPOZI is compatible with polyvinylchloride and polyolefin. Do not dilute with Sodium Chloride Injection at any time, because the product may precipitate. Diluted NYPOZI solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 14 hours. This 14 hour time period includes the time during room temperature storage of the infusion solution and the duration of the infusion. If the patient or caregiver misses a dose of NYPOZI, instruct them to contact their healthcare provider."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal splenic rupture: Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. ( 5.1 ) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NYPOZI in patients with ARDS. ( 5.2 ) Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis: Permanently discontinue NYPOZI in patients with serious allergic reactions. ( 5.3 ) Fatal sickle cell crises: Discontinue NYPOZI if sickle cell crisis occurs. ( 5.4 ) Glomerulonephritis: Evaluate and consider dose-reduction or interruption of NYPOZI if causality is likely. ( 5.5 ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): Monitor patients with breast and lung cancer using NYPOZI in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML. ( 5.8 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, has been reported following the administration of filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NYPOZI in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. Provide symptomatic treatment for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients receiving filgrastim products can recur within days after the discontinuation of initial anti-allergic treatment. Permanently discontinue NYPOZI in patients with serious allergic reactions. NYPOZI is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. 5.4 Sickle Cell Disorders Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur, in patients with sickle cell disorders receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue NYPOZI if sickle cell crisis occurs. 5.5 Glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis has occurred in patients receiving filgrastim products. The diagnoses were based upon azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose-reduction or discontinuation of filgrastim products. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of NYPOZI. 5.6 Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization have been reported in healthy donors treated with filgrastim products undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection mobilization. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of filgrastim products. The use of NYPOZI for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication. 5.7 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) has been reported after G-CSF administration, including filgrastim products, and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.8 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating NYPOZI therapy. MDS and AML have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with filgrastim products for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of filgrastim products on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued filgrastim products administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia\u201a the risks and benefits of continuing NYPOZI should be carefully considered. Patients with Breast and Lung Cancer MDS and AML have been associated with the use of filgrastim products in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Monitor platelet counts. 5.10 Leukocytosis Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy White blood cell counts of 100\u201a000/mm 3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving filgrastim at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day. In patients with cancer receiving NYPOZI as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis\u201a it is recommended that NYPOZI therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10\u201a000/mm 3 after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of NYPOZI that increase the ANC beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a discontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days\u201a with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy During the period of administration of NYPOZI for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue NYPOZI if the leukocyte count rises to > 100,000/mm 3 . 5.11 Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim products. In most cases\u201a the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe. Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term filgrastim therapy. Hold NYPOZI therapy in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. NYPOZI may be started at a reduced dose when the symptoms resolve and the ANC has decreased. 5.12 Potential Effect on Malignant Cells NYPOZI is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor through which NYPOZI acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that NYPOZI acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim products in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established. When NYPOZI is used to mobilize PBPC\u201a tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied\u201a and the limited data available are inconclusive. 5.13 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended The safety and efficacy of NYPOZI given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a do not use NYPOZI in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. The safety and efficacy of NYPOZI have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of NYPOZI with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5.14 Nuclear Imaging Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results. 5.15 Aortitis Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue NYPOZI if aortitis is suspected."

Adverse reactions in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, and insomnia. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection The adverse reaction data in Table 3 are from a series of 7 trials in patients with cancer undergoing mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis. Patients (n = 166) in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 8 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dosage of filgrastim ranged between 5 to 30 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous infusion. The median age was 39 (range 15 to 67) years, and 48% were male. Table 3. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous PBPC in the Mobilization Phase (\u2265 5% Incidence in Filgrastim Patients) System Organ Class Preferred Term Mobilization Phase (N = 166) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Bone pain 30% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 16% Investigations Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 11% Nervous system disorders Headache 10% Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The following adverse reaction data were identified in a randomized, controlled study in patients with SCN receiving filgrastim (Study 7). 123 patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by subcutaneous filgrastim treatment or immediate subcutaneous filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) and 46% were male. The dosage of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dosage of filgrastim: Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dosage was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included arthralgia, bone pain, back pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, splenomegaly, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were higher in the filgrastim arm, total infection related events were lower in filgrastim treated patients), epistaxis, chest pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, and alopecia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of filgrastim products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. splenic rupture and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] acute respiratory distress syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] sickle cell disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] glomerulonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] alveolar hemorrhage and hemoptysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] leukocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] cutaneous vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) decreased bone density and osteoporosis in pediatric patients receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim products myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with breast and lung cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] aortitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] extramedullary hematopoiesis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, including several observational studies of pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to filgrastim products and those who were unexposed, have not established an association with filgrastim products use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). Reports in the scientific literature have described transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women when administered \u2264 30 hours prior to preterm delivery (\u2264 30 weeks gestation). In animal reproduction studies, effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. No maternal or fetal effects were observed in pregnant rats at doses up to 58 times the human doses. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15- 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Several observational studies based on the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) described pregnancy outcomes in women with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) who were exposed to filgrastim products during pregnancy and women with SCN who were unexposed. No major differences were seen between treated and untreated women with respect to pregnancy outcome (including miscarriage and preterm labor), newborn complications (including birth weight), and infections. Methodological limitations of these studies include small sample size and lack of generalizability due to the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data Effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses. In pregnant rabbits showing signs of maternal toxicity, reduced embryo-fetal survival (at 20 and 80 mcg/kg/day) and increased abortions (at 80 mcg/kg/day) were observed. In pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal effects were observed at doses up to 575 mcg/kg/day, which is approximately 58 times higher than the human dose of 10 mcg/kg/day. Offspring of rats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods exhibited a delay in external differentiation and growth retardation (\u2265 20 mcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is published literature documenting transfer of filgrastim into human milk. There are a few case reports describing the use of filgrastim in breastfeeding mothers with no adverse effects noted in the infants. There are no data on the effects of filgrastim products on milk production. Other filgrastim products are secreted poorly into breast milk, and filgrastim products are not absorbed orally by neonates. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for NYPOZI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from NYPOZI or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use NYPOZI prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive\u2122 Needle Guard may not accurately measure volumes less than 0.3 mL due to the needle spring mechanism design. Therefore, the direct administration of a volume less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a 15 pediatric patients median age 2.6 (range 1.2 \u2013 9.4) years with neuroblastoma were treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide\u201a cisplatin\u201a doxorubicin\u201a and etoposide) followed by subcutaneous filgrastim at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mcg/kg/day for 10 days (n = 5/dose) (Study 8). The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adults receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. In this population\u201a filgrastim was well tolerated. There was one report of palpable splenomegaly and one report of hepatosplenomegaly associated with filgrastim therapy; however, the only consistently reported adverse event was musculoskeletal pain\u201a which is no different from the experience in the adult population. The safety and effectiveness of filgrastim have been established in pediatric patients with SCN [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . In a phase 3 study (Study 7) to assess the safety and efficacy of filgrastim in the treatment of SCN, 123 patients with a median age of 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) were studied. Of the 123 patients, 12 were infants (7 months to 2 years of age), 49 were children (2 to 12 years of age), and 9 were adolescents (12 to 16 years of age). Additional information is available from a SCN postmarketing surveillance study, which includes long-term follow-up of patients in the clinical studies and information from additional patients who entered directly into the postmarketing surveillance study. Of the 731 patients in the surveillance study, 429 were pediatric patients < 18 years of age (range 0.9 - 17) [see Indications and Usage (1.5) , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Clinical Studies (14.5 )]. Long-term follow-up data from the postmarketing surveillance study suggest that height and weight are not adversely affected in patients who received up to 5 years of filgrastim treatment. Limited data from patients who were followed in the phase 3 study for 1.5 years did not suggest alterations in sexual maturation or endocrine function. Pediatric patients with congenital types of neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome, congenital agranulocytosis, or Schwachman-Diamond syndrome) have developed cytogenetic abnormalities and have undergone transformation to MDS and AML while receiving chronic filgrastim treatment. The relationship of these events to filgrastim products administration is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Adverse Reactions (6) ]. The use of filgrastim to increase survival in pediatric patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation is based on studies of filgrastim conducted in animals and clinical data supporting the use of filgrastim in other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 to 2.4 ) and Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Among 855 subjects enrolled in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of filgrastim treated-patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there were 232 subjects age 65 or older, and 22 subjects age 75 or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Clinical studies of filgrastim in other approved indications (i.e., BMT recipients, PBPC mobilization, and SCN) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Filgrastim-txid, a leukocyte growth factor, is a 175 amino acid human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Filgrastim-txid is produced by Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gene. Filgrastim-txid has a molecular weight of 18\u201a800 daltons. The protein has an amino acid sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human DNA sequence analysis\u201a except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for expression in E. coli. Because filgrastim-txid is produced in E. coli \u201a the product is non-glycosylated and thus differs from G-CSF isolated from a human cell. NYPOZI (filgrastim-txid) injection is a sterile\u201a clear\u201a colorless to slightly yellowish\u201a preservative-free liquid containing filgrastim-txid at a specific activity of 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10 8 IU/mg (as measured by a cell mitogenesis assay). The product is available in single-dose prefilled syringes for subcutaneous or intravenous use. The single-dose prefilled syringes contain either 300 mcg/0.5 mL or 480 mcg/0.8 mL of filgrastim-txid.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation\u201a differentiation commitment\u201a and some end-cell functional activation. Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes\u201a fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation\u201a differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability\u201a priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst\u201a antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies\u201a administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily), subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)\u201a or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy\u201a neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro. The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however, the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer. White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift), including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts\u201a usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition\u201a Dohle bodies\u201a increased granulocyte granulation\u201a and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Filgrastim products exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is dependent on filgrastim product concentration and neutrophil count: G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance is saturated by high concentration of filgrastim products and is diminished by neutropenia. In addition, filgrastim products are cleared by the kidney. Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL\u201a respectively\u201a within 2 to 8 hours. After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution averaged 150 mL/kg and the elimination half-life was approximately 3.5 hours in both normal subjects and subjects with cancer. Clearance rate of filgrastim was approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/minute/kg. Single parenteral doses or daily intravenous doses\u201a over a 14-day period\u201a resulted in comparable half-lives. The half-lives were similar for intravenous administration (231 minutes\u201a following doses of 34.5 mcg/kg) and for subcutaneous administration (210 minutes\u201a following filgrastim dosages of 3.45 mcg/kg). Continuous 24 hour intravenous infusions of 20 mcg/kg over an 11 to 20 day period produced steady state serum concentrations of filgrastim with no evidence of drug accumulation over the time period investigated. The absolute bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60% to 70%. Specific Populations Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products is not available in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Based on limited pharmacokinetics data in irradiated non-human primates, the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), reflecting the exposure to filgrastim in non-human primates at 10 mcg/kg dose of filgrastim, appears to be similar to that in humans at 5 mcg/kg. Simulations conducted using the population pharmacokinetic model indicates that the exposures to filgrastim at a filgrastim dose of 10 mcg/kg in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation are expected to exceed the exposures at a dose of 10 mcg/kg in irradiated non-human primates. Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adult patients receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Renal Impairment: In a study with healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects with end stage renal disease (n=4 per group), higher serum concentrations were observed in subjects with end-stage renal disease. However, dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary. Hepatic Impairment: Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of filgrastim are similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n = 12/group). The study included 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Therefore, NYPOZI dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of filgrastim or of other filgrastim products. While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim products, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies using filgrastim, the incidence of antibodies binding to filgrastim was 3% (11/333). In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell based bioassay. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of filgrastim products is unknown. Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors."

    "mechanism_of_action": [
      "12.1 Mechanism of Action Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation\u201a differentiation commitment\u201a and some end-cell functional activation. Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes\u201a fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation\u201a differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability\u201a priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst\u201a antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage."

    "pharmacodynamics": [
      "12.2 Pharmacodynamics In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies\u201a administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily), subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)\u201a or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy\u201a neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro. The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however, the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer. White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift), including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts\u201a usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition\u201a Dohle bodies\u201a increased granulocyte granulation\u201a and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection."

    "pharmacokinetics": [
      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Filgrastim products exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is dependent on filgrastim product concentration and neutrophil count: G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance is saturated by high concentration of filgrastim products and is diminished by neutropenia. In addition, filgrastim products are cleared by the kidney. Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL\u201a respectively\u201a within 2 to 8 hours. After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution averaged 150 mL/kg and the elimination half-life was approximately 3.5 hours in both normal subjects and subjects with cancer. Clearance rate of filgrastim was approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/minute/kg. Single parenteral doses or daily intravenous doses\u201a over a 14-day period\u201a resulted in comparable half-lives. The half-lives were similar for intravenous administration (231 minutes\u201a following doses of 34.5 mcg/kg) and for subcutaneous administration (210 minutes\u201a following filgrastim dosages of 3.45 mcg/kg). Continuous 24 hour intravenous infusions of 20 mcg/kg over an 11 to 20 day period produced steady state serum concentrations of filgrastim with no evidence of drug accumulation over the time period investigated. The absolute bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60% to 70%. Specific Populations Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products is not available in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Based on limited pharmacokinetics data in irradiated non-human primates, the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), reflecting the exposure to filgrastim in non-human primates at 10 mcg/kg dose of filgrastim, appears to be similar to that in humans at 5 mcg/kg. Simulations conducted using the population pharmacokinetic model indicates that the exposures to filgrastim at a filgrastim dose of 10 mcg/kg in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation are expected to exceed the exposures at a dose of 10 mcg/kg in irradiated non-human primates. Pediatric Patients: The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adult patients receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ]. Renal Impairment: In a study with healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects with end stage renal disease (n=4 per group), higher serum concentrations were observed in subjects with end-stage renal disease. However, dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary. Hepatic Impairment: Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of filgrastim are similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n = 12/group). The study included 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Therefore, NYPOZI dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to decrease the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia\u201a in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs were established in a randomized\u201a double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with small cell lung cancer (Study 1). In Study 1, patients received up to 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy including intravenous cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin on day 1; and etoposide on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21-day cycles. Patients were randomized to receive filgrastim (n=99) at a dose of 230 mcg/m 2 (4 to 8 mcg/kg/day) or placebo (n=111). Study drug was administered subcutaneously daily beginning on day 4, for a maximum of 14 days. A total of 210 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 207 were evaluable for safety. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 62 (range 31 to 80) years; 64% males; 89% Caucasian; 72% extensive disease, and 28% limited disease. The main efficacy endpoint was the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 1000/mm 3 and temperature > 38.2\u00b0C. Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia, 40% for filgrastim-treated patients and 76% for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). There were also statistically significant reductions in the incidence and overall duration of infection manifested by febrile neutropenia; the incidence, severity and duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ); the incidence and overall duration of hospital admissions; and the number of reported days of antibiotic use. 14.2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was established in a randomized, double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled\u201a multi-center trial in patients with newly diagnosed, de novo AML (Study 4). In Study 4 the initial induction therapy consisted of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous filgrastim (n=259) at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day or placebo (n=262) from 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC \u22651000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days or \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 54 (range 16 to 89) years; 54% males; initial white blood cell count (65% - <25,000 /mm 3 and 27% > 100,000/mm 3 ); 29% unfavorable cytogenetics. The main efficacy endpoint was median duration of severe neutropenia defined as neutrophil count < 500/mm 3 . Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in median number of days of severe neutropenia, filgrastim-treated patients 14 days, placebo-treated patients 19 days (p = 0.0001: difference of 5 days (95% CI: -6.0, -4.0)). There was a reduction in the median duration of intravenous antibiotic use, filgrastim-treated patients: 15 days versus placebo-treated patients: 18.5 days; a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization, filgrastim-treated patients: 20 days versus placebo-treated patients: 25 days. There were no statistically significant differences between the filgrastim and the placebo groups in complete remission rate (69% - filgrastim, 68% - placebo), median time to progression of all randomized patients (165 days - filgrastim, 186 days - placebo), or median overall survival (380 days - filgrastim, 425 days - placebo). 14.3 Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in 2 randomized controlled trials of patients with lymphoma (Study 6 and Study 9). The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial (Study10). In Study 6 patients with Hodgkin's disease received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\"CVP\"), and patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\"BEAM\"). There were 54 patients randomized 1:1:1 to control, filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day, and filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour continuous infusion starting 24 hours after bone marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 57) years; 56% males; 69% Hodgkin's disease and 31% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia ANC < 500/mm 3 . A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) occurred in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (23 days in the control group\u201a 11 days in the 10 mcg/kg/day group\u201a and 14 days in the 30 mcg/kg/day group [11 days in the combined treatment groups\u201a p = 0.004]). In Study 9, patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received a preparative regimen intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\"CVP\"). There were 43 evaluable patients randomized to continuous subcutaneous infusion filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day (n=19), filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day (n=10) and no treatment (n=14) starting the day after marrow infusion for maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 56) years; 67% males; 28% Hodgkin's disease and 72% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia. There was statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (21.5 days in the control group versus 10 days in the filgrastim-treated groups, p < 0.001). The number of days of febrile neutropenia was also reduced significantly in this study (13.5 days in the control group versus 5 days in the filgrastim-treated groups\u201a p < 0.0001). In Study 10, 70 patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplantation for multiple underlying conditions using multiple preparative regimens were randomized to receive filgrastim 300 mcg/m 2 /day (n=33) or placebo (n=37) days 5 through 28 after marrow infusion. The median age was 18 (range 1 to 45) years, 56% males. The underlying disease was: 67% hematologic malignancy, 24% aplastic anemia, 9% other. A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia occurred in the treated group versus the control group (19 days in the control group and 15 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001) and time to recovery of ANC to \u2265 500/mm 3 (21 days in the control group and 16 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001). 14.4 Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to mobilize autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis was supported by the experience in uncontrolled trials, and a randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell rescue using filgrastim mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells to autologous bone marrow (Study 11). Patients in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 7 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dose of filgrastim ranged between 10 to 24 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Engraftment was evaluated in 64 patients who underwent transplantation using filgrastim mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells in uncontrolled trials. Two of the 64 patients (3%) did not achieve the criteria for engraftment as defined by a platelet count \u2265 20\u201a000/mm 3 by day 28. In clinical trials of filgrastim for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells\u201a filgrastim was administered to patients at doses between 5 to 24 mcg/kg/day after reinfusion of the collected cells until a sustainable ANC (\u2265 500/mm 3 ) was reached. The rate of engraftment of these cells in the absence of filgrastim post transplantation has not been studied. Study 11 was a randomized, unblinded study of patients with Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy\u201a 27 patients received filgrastim-mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells and 31 patients received autologous bone marrow. The preparative regimen was intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\"BEAM\"). Patients received daily filgrastim 24 hours after stem cell infusion at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day. The median age was 33 (range 1 to 59) years; 64% males; 57% Hodgkin's disease and 43% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was number of days of platelet transfusions. Patients randomized to filgrastim-mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells compared to autologous bone marrow had significantly fewer days of platelet transfusions (median 6 vs 10 days). 14.5 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of neutropenia (that is fever\u201a infections, oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic adult and pediatric patients with congenital neutropenia\u201a cyclic neutropenia\u201a or idiopathic neutropenia was established in a randomized controlled trial conducted in patients with severe neutropenia (Study 7). Patients eligible for Study 7 had a history of severe chronic neutropenia documented with an ANC < 500/mm 3 on three occasions during a 6-month period, or in patients with cyclic neutropenia 5 consecutive days of ANC < 500/mm 3 per cycle. In addition, patients must have experienced a clinically significant infection during the previous 12 months. Patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by filgrastim treatment or immediate filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years); 46% males; 34% idiopathic, 17% cyclic, and 49% congenital neutropenia. Filgrastim was administered subcutaneously. The dose of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dose of filgrastim: Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dose was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. The main efficacy endpoint was response to filgrastim treatment. ANC response from baseline (< 500/mm 3 ) was defined as follows: Complete response: median ANC > 1500/mm 3 Partial response: median ANC \u2265 500/mm 3 and \u2264 1500/mm 3 with a minimum increase of 100% No response: median ANC < 500/mm 3 There were 112 of 123 patients who demonstrated a complete or partial response to filgrastim treatment. Additional efficacy endpoints included a comparison between patients randomized to 4 months of observation and patients receiving filgrastim of the following parameters: incidence of infection incidence of fever duration of fever incidence, duration, and severity of oropharyngeal ulcers number of days of antibiotic use The incidence for each of these 5 clinical parameters was lower in the filgrastim arm compared to the control arm for cohorts in each of the 3 major diagnostic categories. An analysis of variance showed no significant interaction between treatment and diagnosis\u201a suggesting that efficacy did not differ substantially in the different diseases. Although filgrastim substantially reduced neutropenia in all patient groups\u201a in patients with cyclic neutropenia\u201a cycling persisted but the period of neutropenia was shortened to 1 day. 14.6 Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) Efficacy studies of filgrastim products could not be conducted in humans with acute radiation syndrome for ethical and feasibility reasons. Approval of this indication was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals and data supporting the use of filgrastim for other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 to 2.4 )] . Because of the uncertainty associated with extrapolating animal efficacy data to humans, the selection of human dose for NYPOZI is aimed at providing exposures to filgrastim that exceed those observed in animal efficacy studies. The 10 mcg/kg daily dose is selected for humans exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation because the exposure associated with such a dose is expected to exceed the exposure associated with a 10 mcg/kg dose in non-human primates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety of filgrastim at a daily dose of 10 mcg/kg has been assessed on the basis of clinical experience in approved indications. The efficacy of filgrastim was studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in a non-human primate model of radiation injury. The planned sample size was 62 animals, but the study was stopped at the interim analysis with 46 animals because efficacy was established. Rhesus macaques were randomized to a control (n = 22) or treated (n = 24) group. Animals were exposed to total body irradiation of 7.4 \u00b1 0.15 Gy delivered at 0.8 \u00b1 0.03 Gy/min, representing a dose that would be lethal in 50% of animals by 60 days of follow-up (LD50/60). Starting on day 1 after irradiation, animals received daily subcutaneous injections of placebo (5% dextrose in water) or filgrastim (10 mcg/kg/day). Blinded treatment was stopped when one of the following criteria was met: ANC \u2265 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for more than 2 consecutive days within study day 1 to 5, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 any time after study day 5. Animals received medical management consisting of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, blood transfusions, and other support as required. Filgrastim significantly (at 0.023 level of significance) reduced 60-day mortality in the irradiated non-human primates: 21% mortality (5/24) in the filgrastim group compared to 59% mortality (13/22) in the control group."

NYPOZI is a man-made form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is a substance produced by the body. It stimulates the growth of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important in the body's fight against infection. Acute Radiation Syndrome: The effectiveness of filgrastim for this use was only studied in animals, because it could not be studied in people. Do not take NYPOZI if you have had a serious allergic reaction to human G-CSFs such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. Before you take NYPOZI, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have a sickle cell disorder. have kidney problems. are receiving radiation therapy. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if NYPOZI will harm your unborn baby. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if NYPOZI passes into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How will I receive NYPOZI? NYPOZI injections can be given by a healthcare provider by intravenous (IV) infusion or under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Your healthcare provider may decide subcutaneous injections can be given at home by you or your caregiver. If NYPOZI is given at home, see the detailed \"Instructions for Use\" that comes with your NYPOZI for information on how to prepare and inject a dose of NYPOZI. You and your caregiver should be shown how to prepare and inject NYPOZI before you use it, by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much NYPOZI to inject and when to inject it. Do not change your dose or stop NYPOZI unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You should not inject a dose of NYPOZI less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) from a NYPOZI prefilled syringe. A dose less than 0.3 mL cannot be accurately measured using the NYPOZI prefilled syringe. If you are receiving NYPOZI because you are also receiving chemotherapy, your dose of NYPOZI should be injected at least 24 hours before or 24 hours after your dose of chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to monitor your white blood cell counts, and if necessary, adjust your NYPOZI dose. If you are receiving NYPOZI because you have been suddenly (acutely) exposed to an amount of radiation that can affect your bone marrow (Acute Radiation Syndrome), you will need to have blood tests about every 3 days during treatment with NYPOZI to check your white blood cell count. If you miss a dose of NYPOZI, talk to your healthcare provider about when you should give your next dose. What are the possible side effects of NYPOZI? NYPOZI may cause serious side effects, including: Spleen rupture. Your spleen may become enlarged and can rupture. A ruptured spleen can cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in the left upper stomach (abdomen) area or your left shoulder. A serious lung problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if you have shortness of breath with or without a fever, trouble breathing, or a fast rate of breathing. Serious allergic reactions. NYPOZI can cause serious allergic reactions. These reactions can cause a rash over your whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling around your mouth or eyes, fast heart rate, and sweating. If you have any of these symptoms, stop using NYPOZI and call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away. Sickle cell crises. You may have a serious sickle cell crisis, which could lead to death, if you have a sickle cell disorder and receive NYPOZI. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of sickle cell crisis such as pain or difficulty breathing. Kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). NYPOZI can cause kidney injury. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: swelling of your face or ankles blood in your urine or dark colored urine you urinate less than usual Capillary leak syndrome. NYPOZI can cause fluid to leak from blood vessels into your body's tissues. This condition is called \"Capillary Leak Syndrome\" (CLS). CLS can quickly cause you to have symptoms that may become life-threatening. Get emergency medical help right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: swelling or puffiness and are urinating less than usual trouble breathing swelling of your stomach-area (abdomen) and feeling of fullness dizziness or feeling faint a general feeling of tiredness Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). NYPOZI may increase the risk of developing a precancerous condition called MDS or a type of blood cancer called AML in people who were born with low white blood cell counts (congenital neutropenia). If you have breast cancer or lung cancer, when NYPOZI is used with chemotherapy and radiation therapy or with radiation therapy only, you may have an increased risk of developing MDS or AML. Symptoms of MDS and AML may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. Call your healthcare provider if you develop any of these symptoms during treatment with NYPOZI. Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with NYPOZI. Tell your healthcare provider if you have unusual bleeding or bruising during treatment with NYPOZI. This could be a sign of decreased platelet counts, which may reduce the ability of your blood to clot. Increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with NYPOZI. Inflammation of your blood vessels (cutaneous vasculitis). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop purple spots or redness of your skin. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis). Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported in patients who received filgrastim products. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, feeling tired, and back pain. Call your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms. The most common side effects experienced in patients receiving NYPOZI include: Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy: fever, pain, rash, cough, and shortness of breath Patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy: pain, nose bleed, and rash Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant: rash Patients who are having their own blood cells collected: bone pain, fever, and headache Patients with severe chronic neutropenia: pain, decreased red blood cells, nose bleed, diarrhea, reduced sensation, and hair loss These are not all the possible side effects of NYPOZI. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store NYPOZI? Store NYPOZI in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Keep NYPOZI in the original carton to protect it from light or physical damage. Do not leave NYPOZI in direct sunlight. Do not shake NYPOZI. Take NYPOZI out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. If not used right away, the prefilled syringe may be kept at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) for up to 24 hours. Throw away (dispose of) any NYPOZI that has been left at room temperature for more than 24 hours. After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused NYPOZI left in the prefilled syringe. Do not save unused NYPOZI in the prefilled syringe for later use. Keep NYPOZI and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of NYPOZI: Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use NYPOZI for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give NYPOZI to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about NYPOZI that is written for health professionals. What are the ingredients in NYPOZI?

      "Instructions for Use NYPOZI\u2122 (ni-poz-ee) (filgrastim-txid) injection Single-Dose Prefilled Syringe Guide to Parts Important: The needle is covered by the gray needle cap before use. Important Read the Patient Information for important information you need to know about NYPOZI before using these Instructions for Use. Before you use a NYPOZI prefilled syringe, read this important information. Storing your NYPOZI prefilled syringe Store the NYPOZI prefilled syringe in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze NYPOZI prefilled syringes. Keep the prefilled syringe in the original carton to protect it from light or physical damage. Take the prefilled syringe out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. Throw away (dispose of) any prefilled syringe that has been left at room temperature for longer than 24 hours. After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused NYPOZI left in the prefilled syringe. Do not save unused NYPOZI in the prefilled syringe for later use. Keep the NYPOZI prefilled syringe out of the reach of children. Using your prefilled syringe It is important that you do not try to give the injection unless you or your caregiver has received training from your healthcare provider. Make sure the name NYPOZI appears on the carton and prefilled syringe label. Do not inject a dose of NYPOZI less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) from a NYPOZI prefilled syringe. A dose less than 0.3 mL cannot be accurately measured using the NYPOZI prefilled syringe. Do not use a prefilled syringe after the expiration date on the label. Do not shake the prefilled syringe. Do not remove the gray needle cap from the prefilled syringe until you are ready to inject. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the carton is open or damaged. Do not use a prefilled syringe if it has been dropped on a hard surface. The prefilled syringe may be broken even if you cannot see the break. Use a new prefilled syringe. The prefilled syringe has a needle guard that will be activated to cover the needle after the injection is given. The needle guard will help prevent needle stick injuries to anyone who handles the prefilled syringe. Avoid touching the syringe needle guard wings before use. Touching them may cause the syringe needle guard to be activated too early. Use another prefilled syringe that has not been activated and is ready to use. Call your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Step 1: Prepare A Remove the prefilled syringe carton from the refrigerator. Put the original carton with any unused prefilled syringes back in the refrigerator. Remove the syringe blister pack from the carton. On a clean, well-lit, flat surface, place the syringe blister pack at room temperature for 30 minutes before you give an injection. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the carton is damaged. Do not try to warm the prefilled syringe by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. Keep the prefilled syringe in the blister pack until you are ready to use it. Do not leave the prefilled syringe in direct sunlight. Do not shake the prefilled syringe. Open the blister pack by peeling away the cover. Grab the transparent needle guard to remove the prefilled syringe from the blister pack. For safety reasons: Do not grab the plunger rod. Do not grab the gray needle cap. B Inspect the medicine and prefilled syringe. Turn the prefilled syringe so you can see through the viewing window and dose markings. Make sure the medicine in the prefilled syringe is clear and colorless to slightly yellowish. Check to make sure that the plastic transparent needle guard is covering the barrel of the glass syringe. If the transparent needle guard is covering the gray needle cap (shown below), the needle guard has already been activated. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the needle guard has been activated . Syringe with Activated Needle Guard Do not use the prefilled syringe if: The medicine is cloudy or discolored or contains flakes or particles. Any part appears cracked or broken. The prefilled syringe has been dropped. The gray needle cap is missing or not securely attached. The expiration date printed on the label has passed. In all cases, use a new prefilled syringe and call your healthcare provider. C Gather all materials needed for injection. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. On a clean, well-lit work surface, place the: Prefilled syringe, and the following items, that are not included in the NYPOZI carton Alcohol wipe Cotton ball or gauze pad Adhesive bandage Sharps disposal container or other appropriate disposal container Step 2: Get ready D Prepare and clean your injection site You can use: Thigh Stomach area (abdomen), except for a 2 -inch area right around your navel (belly button) Upper outer area of your buttocks (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. Do not touch this cleansed area again before injecting. If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection site area you used for a previous injection. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. E Hold the prefilled syringe by the syringe barrel (the clear plastic needle guard) with the needle pointing up . Carefully pull the gray needle cap straight off and away from your body. Do not remove the gray needle cap from the prefilled syringe until you are ready to inject. Do not twist or bend the gray needle cap. Do not hold the prefilled syringe by the plunger rod. Do not put the gray needle cap back onto the prefilled syringe. Important: Throw away the gray needle cap into the sharps or other appropriate disposal container. F Check your prescription before you inject your dose Your healthcare provider has prescribed either a \"full\" syringe dose or a \"partial\" syringe dose of NYPOZI. If you are prescribed a full dose, you will inject all of the medicine from your prefilled syringe. For a full dose, go directly to Step 3: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. If you are prescribed a partial dose of NYPOZI, start with Step G below. G Check the syringe for an air bubble. Point the needle up and gently tap the syringe with your fingers until the air bubble rises to the top of the syringe. H Hold the syringe as shown below and press slowly on the plunger to push out the excess medicine until the top edge of the conical base of the plunger stopper lines up with the syringe marking for your prescribed dose. As you push the plunger rod up, air and extra medication is removed. Check to make sure the plunger lines up with the syringe markings for your prescribed dose. If you remove too much medicine, get a new prefilled syringe and start again at Step 1. See the figure below ( Step 2 ) for an example of a dose of 0.4 mL. Your dose may be different than the example shown. Call your healthcare provider if you have problems measuring your prescribed dose. Step 3: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection I With one hand gently pinch the skin at the injection site to create a firm surface. Important: Keep the skin pinched while injecting. J Hold the pinch. With your other hand insert the needle into the skin at a 45 to 90 degree angle as shown . K Using slow and constant pressure, slowly press down on the plunger rod as far as it will go so that the plunger head is completely between the needle guard wings. Do not pull back the plunger rod while the needle is inserted. When done, keep the plunger fully pressed down while you carefully pull the needle straight out from the injection site . Important: When you remove the syringe, if it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, this means you have not received a full dose. Call your healthcare provider right away. Step 4: Finish L Before you finish! Slowly release the plunger and allow the needle guard to automatically cover the exposed needle. Keep your hands away from the needle at all times. M Discard (throw away) your used prefilled syringe. Put the used prefilled syringe in a FDA-cleared sharps or other appropriate disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) your NYPOZI prefilled syringe in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and prefilled syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not reuse the prefilled syringe. Do not recycle the prefilled syringe or sharps disposal container or throw them into household trash. Important: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children. N Examine the injection site. If there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. Apply an adhesive bandage if needed.

      "1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE RELEUKO is a leukocyte growth factor indicated to: Decrease the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia\u201a in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti- cancer drugs associated with a significant incidence of severe neutropenia with fever. ( 1.1 ) Reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). ( 1.2 ) Reduce the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related clinical sequelae\u201a e.g.\u201a febrile neutropenia, in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation (BMT). ( 1.3 ) Mobilize autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis ( 1.4 ) Reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of severe neutropenia (e.g., fever\u201a infections\u201a oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia\u201a cyclic neutropenia\u201a or idiopathic neutropenia. ( 1.5 ) Increase survival in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) ( 1.6 ) 1.1 Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy RELEUKO is indicated to decrease the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia\u201a in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs associated with a significant incidence of severe neutropenia with fever [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. 1.2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy RELEUKO is indicated for reducing the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. 1.3 Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation RELEUKO is indicated to reduce the duration of neutropenia and neutropenia-related clinical sequelae\u201a e.g.\u201a febrile neutropenia, in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplantation [see Clinical Studies ( 14.3 )]. 1.4 Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy RELEUKO is indicated for the mobilization of autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells into the peripheral blood for collection by leukapheresis [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . 1.5 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia RELEUKO is indicated for chronic administration to reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of neutropenia (e.g.\u201a fever\u201a infections\u201a oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic patients with congenital neutropenia\u201a cyclic neutropenia\u201a or idiopathic neutropenia [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. 1.6 Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) RELEUKO is indicated to increase survival in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] ."

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy for AML. Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection, short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or continuous intravenous infusion. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.1 ) Patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration. ( 2.2 ) Patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.3 ) Administer for at least 4 days before first leukapheresis procedure and continue until last leukapheresis ( 2.3 ) Patients with congenital neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 6 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection twice daily ( 2.4 ) Patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection daily ( 2.4 ) Patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.5 ) Direct administration of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) using RELEUKO prefilled syringe is not recommended due to potential for dosing errors. ( 2.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy or Induction and/or Consolidation Chemotherapy for AML The recommended starting dosage of RELEUKO is 5 mcg/kg/day\u201a administered as a single daily injection by subcutaneous injection\u201a by short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes)\u201a or by continuous intravenous infusion. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count before instituting RELEUKO therapy and monitor twice weekly during therapy. Consider dose escalation in increments of 5 mcg/kg for each chemotherapy cycle\u201a according to the duration and severity of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir. Recommend stopping RELEUKO if the ANC increases beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )]. Administer RELEUKO at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Do not administer RELEUKO within the 24- hour period prior to chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )]. A transient increase in neutrophil count is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of RELEUKO therapy. Therefore, to ensure a sustained therapeutic response administer RELEUKO daily for up to 2 weeks or until the ANC has reached 10\u201a000/mm 3 following the expected chemotherapy-induced neutrophil nadir. The duration of RELEUKO therapy needed to attenuate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may be dependent on the myelosuppressive potential of the chemotherapy regimen employed. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The recommended dosage of RELEUKO following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. Administer the first dose of RELEUKO at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after bone marrow infusion. Monitor CBCs and platelet counts frequently following marrow transplantation. During the period of neutrophil recovery\u201a titrate the daily dosage of RELEUKO against the neutrophil response (see Table 1). Table 1. Recommended Dosage Adjustments During Neutrophil Recovery in Patients with Cancer Following BMT Absolute Neutrophil Count RELEUKO Dosage Adjustment When ANC greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days Reduce to 5 mcg/kg/day a Then, if ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 more consecutive days Discontinue RELEUKO Then, if ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 Resume at 5 mcg/kg/day a If ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 at any time during the 5 mcg/kg/day administration\u201a increase RELEUKO to 10 mcg/kg/day\u201a and then follow the above steps. 2.3 Dosage in Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The recommended dosage of RELEUKO for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg/kg/day given by subcutaneous injection. Administer RELEUKO for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continue until the last leukapheresis. Although the optimal duration of RELEUKO administration and leukapheresis schedule have not been established\u201a administration of filgrastim for 6 to 7 days with leukaphereses on days 5\u201a 6\u201a and 7 was found to be safe and effective [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Monitor neutrophil counts after 4 days of RELEUKO\u201a and discontinue RELEUKO if the white blood cell (WBC) count rises to greater than 100\u201a000/mm 3 . 2.4 Dosage in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Prior to starting RELEUKO in patients with suspected chronic neutropenia, confirm the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) by evaluating serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts\u201a and evaluating bone marrow morphology and karyotype. The use of RELEUKO prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of SCN may impair diagnostic efforts and may thus impair or delay evaluation and treatment of an underlying condition\u201a other than SCN\u201a causing the neutropenia. The recommended starting dosage in patients with Congenital Neutropenia is 6 mcg/kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection and the recommended starting dosage in patients with Idiopathic or Cyclic Neutropenia is 5 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection. Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Chronic daily administration is required to maintain clinical benefit. Individualize the dosage based on the patient\u2019s clinical course as well as ANC. In the SCN postmarketing surveillance study, the reported median daily doses of filgrastim were: 6 mcg/kg (congenital neutropenia), 2.1 mcg/kg (cyclic neutropenia), and 1.2 mcg/kg (idiopathic neutropenia). In rare instances, patients with congenital neutropenia have required doses of filgrastim greater than or equal to 100 mcg/kg/day. Monitor CBCs for Dosage Adjustments During the initial 4 weeks of RELEUKO therapy and during the 2 weeks following any dosage adjustment\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts. Once a patient is clinically stable\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts monthly during the first year of treatment. Thereafter, if the patient is clinically stable, less frequent routine monitoring is recommended. 2.5 Dosage in Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) The recommended dose of RELEUKO is 10 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection for patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Administer RELEUKO as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation doses greater than 2 gray (Gy). Estimate a patient\u2019s absorbed radiation dose (i.e., level of radiation exposure) based on information from public health authorities, biodosimetry if available, or clinical findings such as time to onset of vomiting or lymphocyte depletion kinetics. Obtain a baseline CBC and then serial CBCs approximately every third day until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs. Do not delay administration of RELEUKO if a CBC is not readily available. Continue administration of RELEUKO until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs or exceeds 10,000/mm 3 after a radiation-induced nadir. 2.6 Important Administration Instructions RELEUKO is supplied in single-dose vials (for subcutaneous use or intravenous infusion) and single-dose prefilled syringes (for subcutaneous use) [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ]. Prior to use\u201a remove the vial or prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow RELEUKO to reach room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 24 hours. Discard any vial or prefilled syringe left at room temperature for greater than 24 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (the solution is clear and colorless). Do not administer RELEUKO if particulates or discoloration are observed. Discard unused portion of RELEUKO in vials or prefilled syringes; do not re-enter the vial. Do not save unused drug for later administration. Subcutaneous Injection Inject RELEUKO subcutaneously in the outer area of upper arms, abdomen, thighs, or upper outer areas of the buttock. If patients or caregivers are to administer RELEUKO, instruct them in appropriate injection technique and ask them to follow the subcutaneous injection procedures in the Instructions for Use for the vial or prefilled syringe [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Patient self-administration and administration by a caregiver may benefit from training by a healthcare professional. Training by the healthcare provider should aim to demonstrate to those patients and caregivers how to measure the dose of RELEUKO, and the focus should be on ensuring that a patient or caregiver can successfully perform all the steps in the Instructions for Use for the vial or prefilled syringe. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of RELEUKO or whether the patient would benefit from a different RELEUKO presentation. If a patient or caregiver experiences difficulty measuring the required dose, especially if it is other than the entire contents of the RELEUKO prefilled syringe, use of the RELEUKO vial may be considered. If the patient or caregiver misses a dose of RELEUKO, instruct them to contact their healthcare provider. Administration Instructions for the Prefilled Syringe The RELUEKO prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Plus\u2122 Passive Needle Guard is not designed to allow for direct administration of doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg). The spring-mechanism of the needle guard apparatus affixed to the prefilled syringe interferes with the visibility of the graduation markings on the syringe barrel corresponding to 0.1 mL and 0.2 mL. The visibility of these markings is necessary to accurately measure doses of RELEUKO less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) for direct administration. Thus, the direct administration to patients requiring doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. For direct administration of doses less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) use RELUEKO single-dose vial. Administration Instructions for Dilution (Vial Only) If required for intravenous administration\u201a RELEUKO (vial only) may be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP from a concentration of 300 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/mL (do not dilute to a final concentration less than 5 mcg/mL). RELEUKO diluted to concentrations from 5 mcg/mL to 15 mcg/mL should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by the addition of Albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. When diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose plus Albumin (Human)\u201a RELEUKO is compatible with glass bottles\u201a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyolefin intravenous bags\u201a and polypropylene syringes. Do not dilute with saline at any time because the product may precipitate. Diluted RELEUKO solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 4 hours. This 4-hour time period includes the time during room temperature storage of the infusion solution and the duration of the infusion."

( 5.1 ) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue RELEUKO in patients with ARDS. ( 5.2 ) Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis: Permanently discontinue RELEUKO in patients with serious allergic reactions. ( 5.3 ) Fatal sickle cell crises: Discontinue RELEUKO if sickle cell crisis occurs. ( 5.4 ) Glomerulonephritis: Evaluate and consider dose-reduction or interruption of RELEUKO if causality is likely. ( 5.5 ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): Monitor patients with breast and lung cancer using RELEUKO in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML. ( 5.8 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts. ( 5.9 ) Aortitis: Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue RELEUKO if aortitis is suspected. ( 5.15 ) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, has been reported following the administration of filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue RELEUKO in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. Provide symptomatic treatment for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients receiving filgrastim products can recur within days after the discontinuation of initial anti-allergic treatment. Permanently discontinue RELEUKO in patients with serious allergic reactions. RELEUKO is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. 5.4 Sickle Cell Disorders Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur in patients with sickle cell disorders receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue RELEUKO if sickle cell crisis occurs. 5.5 Glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis has occurred in patients receiving filgrastim products. The diagnoses were based upon azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose-reduction or discontinuation of filgrastim products. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of RELEUKO. 5.6 Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization have been reported in healthy donors treated with filgrastim products undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection mobilization. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of filgrastim products. The use of RELEUKO for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication. 5.7 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) has been reported after G-CSF administration, including filgrastim products, and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.8 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating RELEUKO therapy. MDS and AML have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with filgrastim products for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of filgrastim products on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued filgrastim products administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia\u201a the risks and benefits of continuing RELEUKO should be carefully considered. Patients with Breast and Lung Cancer MDS and AML have been associated with the use of filgrastim products in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Monitor platelet counts. 5.10 Leukocytosis Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy White blood cell counts of 100\u201a000/mm 3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving filgrastim at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day. In patients with cancer receiving RELEUKO as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis\u201a it is recommended that RELEUKO therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10\u201a000/mm 3 after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of RELEUKO that increase the ANC beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a discontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days\u201a with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy During the period of administration of RELEUKO for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue RELEUKO if the leukocyte count rises to > 100,000/mm 3 . 5.11 Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim products. In most cases\u201a the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe. Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term filgrastim therapy. Hold RELEUKO therapy in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. RELEUKO may be started at a reduced dose when the symptoms resolve and the ANC has decreased. 5.12 Potential Effect on Malignant Cells RELEUKO is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor through which RELEUKO acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that RELEUKO acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim products in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established. When RELEUKO is used to mobilize PBPC\u201a tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied\u201a and the limited data available are inconclusive. 5.13 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended The safety and efficacy of RELEUKO given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a do not use RELEUKO in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )]. The safety and efficacy of RELEUKO have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of RELEUKO with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5.14 Nuclear Imaging Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results. 5.15 Aortitis Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue RELEUKO if aortitis is suspected."

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Adverse reaction data below are from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with AML (Study 4) who received an induction chemotherapy regimen of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5 and up to 3 additional courses of therapy (induction 2, and consolidation 1, 2) of intravenous daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and etoposide. The safety population included 518 patients randomized to receive either 5 mcg/kg/day filgrastim (n = 257) or placebo (n = 261). The median age was 54 (range 16 to 89) years and 54% were male. Adverse reactions with \u2265 2% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to placebo included epistaxis, back pain, pain in extremity, erythema, and rash maculo-papular. Adverse events with \u2265 2% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to placebo and associated with the sequelae of the underlying malignancy or cytotoxic chemotherapy included diarrhea, constipation, and transfusion reaction. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The following adverse reaction data are from one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma receiving high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or cytarabine, and melphalan) and total body irradiation (Study 5) and one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and NHL undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (Study 6). Patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation only were included in the analysis. A total of 100 patients received either 30 mcg/kg/day as a 4-hour infusion (Study 5) or 10 mcg/kg/day or 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour infusion (Study 6) filgrastim (n = 72), no treatment control or placebo (n = 28). The median age was 30 (range 15 to 57) years, 57% were male. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included rash and hypersensitivity. Adverse reactions in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, and insomnia. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection The adverse reaction data in Table 3 are from a series of 7 trials in patients with cancer undergoing mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis. Patients (n = 166) in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: Filgrastim was administered for 6 to 8 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dosage of filgrastim ranged between 5 to 30 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous infusion. The median age was 39 (range 15 to 67) years, and 48% were male. Table 3. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous PBPC in the Mobilization Phase (\u2265 5% Incidence in Filgrastim Patients) System Organ Class Preferred Term Mobilization Phase (N = 166) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Bone pain 30% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 16% Investigations Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 11% Nervous system disorders Headache 10% Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The following adverse reaction data were identified in a randomized, controlled study in patients with SCN receiving filgrastim (Study 7). 123 patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by subcutaneous filgrastim treatment or immediate subcutaneous filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) and 46% were male. The dosage of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dosage of filgrastim: Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dosage was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included arthralgia, bone pain, back pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, splenomegaly, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were higher in the filgrastim arm, total infection related events were lower in filgrastim-treated patients), epistaxis, chest pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, and alopecia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of filgrastim products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. splenic rupture and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] acute respiratory distress syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] sickle cell disorders [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] glomerulonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] alveolar hemorrhage and hemoptysis [see Warnings and Precautious ( 5.6 )] capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.7 )] leukocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] cutaneous vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) decreased bone density and osteoporosis in pediatric patients receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim products myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with breast and lung cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 )] aortitis [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )] extramedullary hematopoiesis"

      "USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, including several observational studies of pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to filgrastim products and those who were unexposed, have not established an association with filgrastim product use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). Reports in the scientific literature have described transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women when administered \u2264 30 hours prior to preterm delivery (\u2264 30 weeks gestation). In animal reproduction studies, effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. No maternal or fetal effects were observed in pregnant rats at doses up to 58 times the human doses. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Several observational studies based on the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) described pregnancy outcomes in women with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) who were exposed to filgrastim products during pregnancy and women with SCN who were unexposed. No major differences were seen between treated and untreated women with respect to pregnancy outcome (including miscarriage and preterm labor), newborn complications (including birth weight), and infections. Methodological limitations of these studies include small sample size and lack of generalizability due to the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data Effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses. In pregnant rabbits showing signs of maternal toxicity, reduced embryo-fetal survival (at 20 and 80 mcg/kg/day) and increased abortions (at 80 mcg/kg/day) were observed. In pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal effects were observed at doses up to 575 mcg/kg/day, which is approximately 58 times higher than the human dose of 10 mcg/kg/day. Offspring of rats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods exhibited a delay in external differentiation and growth retardation (\u2265 20 mcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is published literature documenting transfer of filgrastim into human milk. There are a few case reports describing the use of filgrastim in breastfeeding mothers with no adverse effects noted in the infants. There are no data on the effects of filgrastim products on milk production. Other filgrastim products are secreted poorly into breast milk, and filgrastim products are not absorbed orally by neonates. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for RELEUKO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from RELEUKO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use RELEUKO prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Plus\u2122 Passive Needle Guard may not accurately measure volumes less than 0.3 mL due to the needle spring mechanism design. Therefore, the direct administration of a volume less than 0.3 mL using RELEUKO prefilled syringe is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. For direct administration of doses less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) use RELEUKO single-dose vial. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a 15 pediatric patients median age 2.6 (range 1.2 to 9.4) years with neuroblastoma were treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide\u201a cisplatin\u201a doxorubicin\u201a and etoposide) followed by subcutaneous filgrastim at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mcg/kg/day for 10 days (n = 5/dose) (Study 8). The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adults receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. In this population\u201a filgrastim was well tolerated. There was one report of palpable splenomegaly and one report of hepatosplenomegaly associated with filgrastim therapy; however\u201a the only consistently reported adverse event was musculoskeletal pain\u201a which is no different from the experience in the adult population. The safety and effectiveness of RELEUKO have been established in pediatric patients with SCN [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )]. In a phase 3 study (Study 7) to assess the safety and efficacy of filgrastim in the treatment of SCN, 123 patients with a median age of 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) were studied. Of the 123 patients, 12 were infants (7 months to 2 years of age), 49 were children (2 to 12 years of age), and 9 were adolescents (12 to 16 years of age). Additional information is available from a SCN postmarketing surveillance study, which includes long-term follow-up of patients in the clinical studies and information from additional patients who entered directly into the postmarketing surveillance study. Of the 731 patients in the surveillance study, 429 were pediatric patients < 18 years of age (range 0.9 to 17) [see Indications and Usage ( 1.5 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )]. Long-term follow-up data from the postmarketing surveillance study suggest that height and weight are not adversely affected in patients who received up to 5 years of filgrastim treatment. Limited data from patients who were followed in the phase 3 study for 1.5 years did not suggest alterations in sexual maturation or endocrine function. Pediatric patients with congenital types of neutropenia (Kostmann\u2019s syndrome, congenital agranulocytosis, or Schwachman-Diamond syndrome) have developed cytogenetic abnormalities and have undergone transformation to MDS and AML while receiving chronic filgrastim treatment. The relationship of these events to filgrastim product administration is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )]. The use of RELEUKO to increase survival in pediatric patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation is based on studies of filgrastim conducted in animals and clinical data supporting the use of filgrastim in other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 to 2.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Among 855 subjects enrolled in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of filgrastim-treated patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there were 232 subjects age 65 or older, and 22 subjects age 75 or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Clinical studies of filgrastim in other approved indications (i.e., BMT recipients, PBPC mobilization, and SCN) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Filgrastim-ayow, a leukocyte growth factor, is a 175 amino acid human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Filgrastim-ayow is produced by Escherichia coli ( E coli ) bacteria into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gene. Filgrastim-ayow has a molecular weight of 18\u201a800 daltons. The protein has an amino acid sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human DNA sequence analysis\u201a except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for expression in E coli . Because filgrastim-ayow is produced in E coli \u201a the product is non-glycosylated and thus differs from G-CSF isolated from a human cell. Kanamycin, 50 mcg/mL is final concentration, is used during the fermentation step of the manufacturing process. Kanamycin is not detectable in the final product. RELEUKO (filgrastim-ayow) injection is a sterile\u201a clear\u201a colorless\u201a preservative-free liquid containing filgrastim-ayow at a specific activity of 1.0 \u00b1 0.6 x 10 8 U/mg (as measured by a cell mitogenesis assay). The product is available in single-dose vials for subcutaneous or intravenous use and prefilled syringes for subcutaneous use. The single-dose vials contain either 300 mcg/mL or 480 mcg/1.6 mL of filgrastim-ayow. The single-dose prefilled syringes contain either 300 mcg/0.5 mL or 480 mcg/0.8 mL of filgrastim-ayow. The RELEUKO drug product has a pH of 4.0.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation\u201a differentiation commitment\u201a and some end-cell functional activation. Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes\u201a fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation\u201a differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability\u201a priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst\u201a antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies\u201a filgrastim administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)\u201a subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily), or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy\u201a neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro. The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however\u201a the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer. White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)\u201a including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts\u201a usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition\u201a Dohle bodies\u201a increased granulocyte granulation\u201a and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Filgrastim products exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is dependent on filgrastim product concentration and neutrophil count: G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance is saturated by high concentration of filgrastim products and is diminished by neutropenia. In addition, filgrastim products are cleared by the kidney. Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL\u201a respectively\u201a within 2 to 8 hours. After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution averaged 150 mL/kg and the elimination half-life was approximately 3.5 hours in both normal subjects and subjects with cancer. Clearance rates of filgrastim were approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/minute/kg. Single parenteral doses or daily intravenous doses\u201a over a 14-day period\u201a resulted in comparable half-lives. The half-lives were similar for intravenous administration (231 minutes\u201a following doses of 34.5 mcg/kg) and for subcutaneous administration (210 minutes\u201a following filgrastim dosages of 3.45 mcg/kg). Continuous 24-hour intravenous infusions of 20 mcg/kg over an 11 to 20-day period produced steady-state serum concentrations of filgrastim with no evidence of drug accumulation over the time period investigated. The absolute bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60% to 70%. Specific Populations Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products are not available in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Based on limited pharmacokinetics data in irradiated non-human primates, the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), reflecting the exposure to filgrastim in non-human primates at 10 mcg/kg dose of filgrastim, appears to be similar to that in humans at 5 mcg/kg. Simulations conducted using the population pharmacokinetic model indicates that the exposures to filgrastim at a filgrastim dose of 10 mcg/kg in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation are expected to exceed the exposures at a dose of 10 mcg/kg in irradiated non-human primates. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adult patients receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )]. Renal Impairment In a study with healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects with end-stage renal disease (n = 4 per group), higher serum concentrations were observed in subjects with end-stage renal disease. However, dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary. Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of filgrastim are similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n = 12/group). The study included 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Therefore, RELEUKO dose adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of filgrastim or of other filgrastim products. While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim products, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies using filgrastim, the incidence of antibodies binding to filgrastim was 3% (11/333). In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell based bioassay. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of filgrastim products is unknown. Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to decrease the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia\u201a in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs were established in a randomized\u201a double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with small cell lung cancer (Study 1). In Study 1, patients received up to 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy including intravenous cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin on day 1; and etoposide on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21 day cycles. Patients were randomized to receive filgrastim (n = 99) at a dose of 230 mcg/m 2 (4 to 8 mcg/kg/day) or placebo (n = 111). Study drug was administered subcutaneously daily beginning on day 4, for a maximum of 14 days. A total of 210 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 207 were evaluable for safety. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 62 (range 31 to 80) years; 64% males; 89% Caucasian; 72% extensive disease and 28% limited disease. The main efficacy endpoint was the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 1,000/mm 3 and temperature > 38.2\u00b0C. Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia, 40% for filgrastim-treated patients and 76% for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). There were also statistically significant reductions in the incidence and overall duration of infection manifested by febrile neutropenia; the incidence, severity and duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ); the incidence and overall duration of hospital admissions; and the number of reported days of antibiotic use. 14.2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was established in a randomized, double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled\u201a multi-center trial in patients with newly diagnosed, de novo AML (Study 4). In Study 4 the initial induction therapy consisted of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous filgrastim (n = 259) at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day or placebo (n = 262) from 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC \u2265 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days or \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 54 (range 16 to 89) years; 54% males; initial white blood cell count (65% - <25,000 /mm 3 and 27% > 100,000/mm 3 ); 29% unfavorable cytogenetics. The main efficacy endpoint was median duration of severe neutropenia defined as neutrophil count < 500/mm 3 . Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in median number of days of severe neutropenia, filgrastim-treated patients 14 days, placebo-treated patients 19 days (p = 0.0001: difference of 5 days (95% CI: -6.0, -4.0)). There was a reduction in the median duration of intravenous antibiotic use, filgrastim- treated patients: 15 days versus placebo-treated patients: 18.5 days; a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization, filgrastim-treated patients: 20 days versus placebo-treated patients: 25 days. There were no statistically significant differences between the filgrastim and the placebo groups in complete remission rate (69% - filgrastim, 68% - placebo), median time to progression of all randomized patients (165 days - filgrastim, 186 days - placebo), or median overall survival (380 days \u2013 filgrastim, 425 days \u2013 placebo). 14.3 Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in 2 randomized controlled trials of patients with lymphoma (Study 6 and Study 9). The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial (Study 10). In Study 6, patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\u201cCVP\u201d), and patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma received intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\u201cBEAM\u201d). There were 54 patients randomized 1:1:1 to control, filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day, and filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour continuous infusion starting 24 hours after bone marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 57) years; 56% males; 69% Hodgkin\u2019s disease and 31% non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia ANC < 500/mm 3 . A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) occurred in the filgrastim - treated groups versus the control group (23 days in the control group\u201a 11 days in the 10 mcg/kg/day group\u201a and 14 days in the 30 mcg/kg/day group [11 days in the combined treatment groups\u201a p = 0.004]). In Study 9, patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\u201cCVP\u201d). There were 43 evaluable patients randomized to continuous subcutaneous infusion filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day (n = 19), filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day (n = 10) and no treatment (n = 14) starting the day after marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 56) years; 67% males; 28% Hodgkin\u2019s disease and 72% non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia. There was statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (21.5 days in the control group versus 10 days in the filgrastim-treated groups, p < 0.001). The number of days of febrile neutropenia was also reduced significantly in this study (13.5 days in the control group versus 5 days in the filgrastim-treated groups\u201a p < 0.0001). In Study 10, 70 patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplantation for multiple underlying conditions using multiple preparative regimens were randomized to receive filgrastim 300 mcg/m 2 /day (n = 33) or placebo (n = 37) days 5 through 28 after marrow infusion. The median age was 18 (range 1 to 45) years, 56% males. The underlying disease was: 67% hematologic malignancy, 24% aplastic anemia, 9% other. A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia occurred in the treated group versus the control group (19 days in the control group and 15 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001) and time to recovery of ANC to \u2265 500/mm 3 (21 days in the control group and 16 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001). 14.4 Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to mobilize autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis was supported by the experience in uncontrolled trials, and a randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell rescue using filgrastim -mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells to autologous bone marrow (Study 11). Patients in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 7 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dose of filgrastim ranged between 10 to 24 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Engraftment was evaluated in 64 patients who underwent transplantation using filgrastim -mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells in uncontrolled trials. Two of the 64 patients (3%) did not achieve the criteria for engraftment as defined by a platelet count \u2265 20\u201a000/mm3 by day 28. In clinical trials of filgrastim for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells\u201a filgrastim was administered to patients at doses between 5 to 24 mcg/kg/day after reinfusion of the collected cells until a sustainable ANC (\u2265 500/mm3) was reached. The rate of engraftment of these cells in the absence of filgrastim post transplantation has not been studied. Study 11 was a randomized, unblinded study of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy\u201a 27 patients received filgrastim-mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells and 31 patients received autologous bone marrow. Thepreparative regimen was intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\u201cBEAM\u201d). Patients received daily filgrastim 24 hours after stem cell infusion at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day. The median age was 33 (range 1 to 59) years; 64% males; 57% Hodgkin\u2019s disease and 43% non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was number of days of platelet transfusions. Patients randomized to filgrastim -mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells compared to autologous bone marrow had significantly fewer days of platelet transfusions (median 6 vs 10 days). 14.5 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of neutropenia (that is fever\u201a infections, oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic adult and pediatric patients with congenital neutropenia\u201a cyclic neutropenia\u201a or idiopathic neutropenia was established in a randomized controlled trial conducted in patients with severe neutropenia (Study 7). Patients eligible for Study 7 had a history of severe chronic neutropenia documented with an ANC < 500/mm 3 on three occasions during a 6-month period, or in patients with cyclic neutropenia 5 consecutive days of ANC < 500/mm 3 per cycle. In addition, patients must have experienced a clinically significant infection during the previous 12 months. Patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by filgrastim treatment or immediate filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years); 46% males; 34% idiopathic, 17% cyclic and 49% congenital neutropenia. Filgrastim was administered subcutaneously. The dose of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dose of filgrastim: Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dose was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. The main efficacy endpoint was response to filgrastim treatment. ANC response from baseline (< 500/mm 3 ) was defined as follows: Complete response: median ANC > 1,500/mm 3 Partial response: median ANC \u2265 500/mm 3 and \u2264 1,500/mm 3 with a minimum increase of 100% No response: median ANC < 500/mm 3 There were 112 of 123 patients who demonstrated a complete or partial response to filgrastim treatment. Additional efficacy endpoints included a comparison between patients randomized to 4 months of observation and patients receiving filgrastim of the following parameters: incidence of infection incidence of fever duration of fever incidence, duration, and severity of oropharyngeal ulcers number of days of antibiotic use The incidence for each of these 5 clinical parameters was lower in the filgrastim arm compared to the control arm for cohorts in each of the 3 major diagnostic categories. An analysis of variance showed no significant interaction between treatment and diagnosis\u201a suggesting that efficacy did not differ substantially in the different diseases. Although filgrastim substantially reduced neutropenia in all patient groups\u201a in patients with cyclic neutropenia\u201a cycling persisted but the period of neutropenia was shortened to 1 day. 14.6 Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) Efficacy studies of filgrastim products could not be conducted in humans with acute radiation syndrome for ethical and feasibility reasons. Approval of this indication was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals and data supporting the use of filgrastim for other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 to 2.4 )] . Because of the uncertainty associated with extrapolating animal efficacy data to humans, the selection of human dose for RELEUKO is aimed at providing exposures to filgrastim that exceed those observed in animal efficacy studies. The 10 mcg/kg daily dose is selected for humans exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation because the exposure associated with such a dose is expected to exceed the exposure associated with a 10 mcg/kg dose in non-human primates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The safety of filgrastim at a daily dose of 10 mcg/kg has been assessed on the basis of clinical experience in approved indications. The efficacy of filgrastim was studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in a non-human primate model of radiation injury. The planned sample size was 62 animals, but the study was stopped at the interim analysis with 46 animals because efficacy was established. Rhesus macaques were randomized to a control (n = 22) or treated (n = 24) group. Animals were exposed to total body irradiation of 7.4 \u00b1 0.15 Gy delivered at 0.8 \u00b1 0.03 Gy/min, representing a dose that would be lethal in 50% of animals by 60 days of follow-up (LD50/60). Starting on day 1 after irradiation, animals received daily subcutaneous injections of placebo (5% dextrose in water) or filgrastim (10 mcg/kg/day). Blinded treatment was stopped when one of the following criteria was met: ANC \u2265 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for more than 2 consecutive days within study day 1 to 5, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 any time after study day 5. Animals received medical management consisting of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, blood transfusions, and other support as required. Filgrastim significantly (at 0.023 level of significance) reduced 60-day mortality in the irradiated non-human primates: 21% mortality (5/24) in the filgrastim group compared to 59% mortality (13/22) in the control group."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Review the steps for direct patient administration with patients and caregivers. Training by the healthcare provider should aim to ensure that patients and caregivers can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use of RELEUKO vial and prefilled syringe, including showing the patient or caregiver how to measure the required dose, particularly if a patient is on a dose other than the entire prefilled syringe. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of RELEUKO or whether the patient would benefit from a different RELEUKO presentation. Advise patients of the following risks and potential risks with RELEUKO: Rupture or enlargement of the spleen may occur. Symptoms include left upper quadrant abdominal pain or left shoulder pain. Advise patients to report pain in these areas to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )]. Dyspnea, with or without fever, progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, may occur. Advise patients to report dyspnea to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )]. Serious allergic reactions may occur, which may be signaled by rash, facial edema, wheezing, dyspnea, hypotension, or tachycardia. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. In patients with sickle cell disease, sickle cell crisis and death have occurred. Discuss potential risks and benefits for patients with sickle cell disease prior to the administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )]. Glomerulonephritis may occur. Symptoms include swelling of the face or ankles, dark colored urine or blood in the urine, or a decrease in urine production. Advise patients to report signs or symptoms of glomerulonephritis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )]. There may be an increased risk of Myelodysplastic Syndrome and/or Acute Myeloid Leukemia in patients with congenital neutropenia who receive filgrastim products and in patients with breast and lung cancer who receive filgrastim products in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Symptoms of MDS and AML may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. Advise patients to report to their physician signs and symptoms of MDS/AML [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) ]. Cutaneous vasculitis may occur, which may be signaled by purpura or erythema. Advise patients to report signs or symptoms of vasculitis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )]. Aortitis may occur. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of aortitis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )]. Advise patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) that efficacy studies of filgrastim products for this indication could not be conducted in humans for ethical and feasibility reasons and that, therefore, approval of this use was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] . Instruct patients who self-administer RELEUKO using the prefilled syringe or single-dose vial of the: Importance of following the applicable Instructions for Use. Dangers of reusing needles, syringes, or unused portions of single-dose vials. Importance of following local requirements for proper disposal of used syringes, needles, and unused vials. Importance of informing the healthcare provider if difficulty occurs when measuring or administering partial contents of the RELEUKO prefilled syringe. If difficulty occurs, use of the RELEUKO vial may be considered. Difference in product concentration of the RELEUKO prefilled syringe in comparison to the RELEUKO vial. When switching patients from the RELEUKO prefilled syringe to the RELEUKO vial, or vice versa, ensure that patients understand the correct volume to be administered since the concentration of RELEUKO differs between the prefilled syringe and the vial.

      "PATIENT INFORMATION RELEUKO \u00ae (reh-loo-koe) (filgrastim-ayow) injection What is RELEUKO? RELEUKO is a man-made form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is a substance produced by the body. It stimulates the growth of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important in the body\u2019s fight against infection. Acute Radiation Syndrome: The effectiveness of filgrastim for this use was only studied in animals, because it could not be studied in people. Do not take RELEUKO if you have had a serious allergic reaction to human G-CSFs such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. Before you take RELEUKO, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have a sickle cell disorder. have kidney problems. are receiving radiation therapy. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if RELEUKO will harm your unborn baby. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if RELEUKO passes into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How will I receive RELEUKO? RELEUKO injections can be given by a healthcare provider by intravenous (IV) infusion or under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Your healthcare provider may decide subcutaneous injections can be given at home by you or your caregiver. If RELEUKO is given at home, see the detailed \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d that comes with your RELEUKO for information on how to prepare and inject a dose of RELEUKO. You and your caregiver should be shown how to prepare and inject RELEUKO before you use it, by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much RELEUKO to inject and when to inject it. Do not change your dose or stop RELEUKO unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You should not inject a dose of RELEUKO less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) from a RELEUKO prefilled syringe. A dose less than 0.3 mL cannot be accurately measured using the RELEUKO prefilled syringe. If you are receiving RELEUKO because you are also receiving chemotherapy, your dose of RELEUKO should be injected at least 24 hours before or 24 hours after your dose of chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to monitor your white blood cell count, and if necessary, adjust your RELEUKO dose. If you are receiving RELEUKO because you have been suddenly (acutely) exposed to an amount of radiation that can affect your bone marrow (Acute Radiation Syndrome), you will need to have blood tests about every 3 days during treatment with RELEUKO to check your white blood cell count. If you miss a dose of RELEUKO, talk to your healthcare provider about when you should give your next dose. What are the possible side effects of RELEUKO? RELEUKO may cause serious side effects, including: Spleen rupture . Your spleen may become enlarged and can rupture. A ruptured spleen can cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in the left upper stomach (abdomen) area or your left shoulder. A serious lung problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if you have shortness of breath with or without a fever, trouble breathing, or a fast rate of breathing. Serious allergic reactions. RELEUKO can cause serious allergic reactions. These reactions can cause a rash over your whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling around your mouth or eyes, fast heart rate, and sweating. If you have any of these symptoms, stop using RELEUKO and call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away. Sickle cell crises. You may have a serious sickle cell crisis, which could lead to death, if you have a sickle cell disorder and receive RELEUKO. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of sickle cell crisis such as pain or difficulty breathing. Kidney injury (glomerulonephritis) . RELEUKO can cause kidney injury. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: swelling of your face or ankles blood in your urine or dark colored urine you urinate less than usual Capillary leak syndrome. RELEUKO can cause fluid to leak from blood vessels into your body\u2019s tissues. This condition is called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d (CLS). CLS can quickly cause you to have symptoms that may become life-threatening. Get emergency medical help right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: swelling or puffiness and are urinating less than usual trouble breathing swelling of your stomach area (abdomen) and feeling of fullness dizziness or feeling faint a general feeling of tiredness Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . RELEUKO may increase the risk of developing a precancerous condition called MDS or a type of blood cancer called AML in people who were born with low white blood cell counts (congenital neutropenia). If you have breast cancer or lung cancer, when RELEUKO is used with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, or with radiation therapy only, you may have an increased risk of developing MDS or AML. Symptoms of MDS and AML may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. Call your healthcare provider if you develop any of these symptoms during treatment with RELEUKO. Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with RELEUKO. Tell your healthcare provider if you have unusual bleeding or bruising during treatment with RELEUKO. This could be a sign of decreased platelet counts, which may reduce the ability of your blood to clot. Increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with RELEUKO. Inflammation of your blood vessels (cutaneous vasculitis). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop purple spots or redness of your skin. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis). Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported in patients who received filgrastim products. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, feeling tired, and back pain. Call your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms. The most common side effects experienced in patients receiving RELEUKO include: Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy: fever, pain, rash, cough, and shortness of breath Patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy: pain, nose bleed, and rash Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant: rash Patients who are having their own blood cells collected: bone pain, fever, and headache Patients with severe chronic neutropenia: pain, decreased red blood cells, nose bleed, diarrhea, reduced sensation, and hair loss These are not all the possible side effects of RELEUKO. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store RELEUKO?

You can use: Thigh Stomach area (abdomen), except for a 2 -inch area right around your navel (belly button) Upper outer area of your buttocks (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. Do not touch this area again before injecting. If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection site area you used for a previous injection. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. E Hold the prefilled syringe by the syringe barrel. Carefully pull the gray needle cap straight off and away from your body. Do not remove the gray needle cap from the prefilled syringe until you are ready to inject. Do not twist or bend the gray needle cap. Do not hold the prefilled syringe by the plunger rod. Do not put the gray needle cap back onto the prefilled syringe. Important: Throw the gray needle cap into the sharps disposal container. F Check your prescription before you inject your dose . Your healthcare provider has prescribed either a \u201cfull\u201d syringe dose or a \u201cpartial\u201d syringe dose of RELEUKO. If you are prescribed a full dose, you will inject all of the medicine from your prefilled syringe. For a full dose, go directly to Step 3: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. If you are prescribed a partial dose of RELEUKO, start with Step G below. G Point the needle up and tap gently until the air bubbles rise to the top. H Slowly push the plunger rod up to the line on the syringe barrel that matches your prescribed dose As you push the plunger rod up, air and extra medicine is removed. Check to make sure the top edge of plunger stopper lines up with the syringe markings for your prescribed dose. If you remove too much medicine, get a new prefilled syringe and start again at Step 1 . See the figure above for an example of a dose of 0.4 mL. Your dose may be different than the example shown. Call your healthcare provider if you have problems measuring your prescribed dose. Step 3: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection I Pinch your injection site to create a firm surface. Important: Keep skin pinched while injecting. J Hold the pinch. Insert the needle into the skin at 45 to 90 degrees. K Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger rod until it reaches the bottom. Do not pull back the plunger rod while the needle is inserted. Press down slowly on the plunger as far as it will go so that the plunger head is completely between the needle guard wings. Important: When you remove the syringe, if it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, this means you have not received a full dose. Call your healthcare provider right away. Step 4: Finish L Finish your injection. While you continue to hold the syringe, slowly let go of the plunger head. As you let go of the plunger head, the needle will automatically slide into the clear safety guard until the needle is completely covered. Important: If the clear safety guard does not activate after Step L, remove the needle from the skin and throw away (discard of) the used prefilled syringe as instructed in Step M right away. M Discard (throw away) the used prefilled syringe. Put the used prefilled syringe in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) the prefilled syringe in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not reuse the prefilled syringe. Do not recycle the prefilled syringe or sharps disposal container or throw them into household trash. Important: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children. N Examine the injection site. If there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. Apply an adhesive bandage if needed. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "Instructions for Use (Vials) RELEUKO \u00ae (reh-loo-koe) (filgrastim-ayow) Injection Single-Dose Vial Important Read the Patient Information for important information you need to know about RELEUKO before using these Instructions for Use. Before you use a RELEUKO vial, read this important information: Storing your RELEUKO vial Store the vial in the refrigerator between 36\u02daF to 46\u02daF (2\u02daC to 8\u02daC). Do not freeze. Keep the vial in the original pack to protect from light or physical damage. Take the vial out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. Throw away (dispose of) any vial that has been left at room temperature for longer than 24 hours. After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused RELEUKO left in the vial. Do not save unused RELEUKO in the vial for later use. Keep RELEUKO and all medicines out of the reach of children. Using your vial It is important that you do not try to give the injection unless you or your caregiver has received training from your healthcare provider. Make sure the name RELEUKO appears on the pack and vial label. Only use the vial 1 time. Discard (throw away) the vial with any remaining RELEUKO liquid. Do not use a vial after the expiration date on the label. Do not shake the vial. Do not use the vial if the medicine is cloudy or discolored or contains flakes or particles. Call your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Step 1: Prepare A Remove the vial from the refrigerator. On a clean, well-lit surface, place the vial at room temperature for 30 minutes before you give an injection. Do not try to warm the vial by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. Do not leave the vial in direct sunlight. Do not shake the vial. Use the vial only 1 time. B Inspect the vial. Make sure the medicine in the vial is clear and colorless. Do not use the vial if: The medicine is cloudy or discolored or contains flakes or particles. The expiration date printed on the label has passed. In all cases, use a new vial and call your healthcare provider. C Gather all materials needed for your injection. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. On a clean, well-lit work surface, place the: 1 Vial 1 Disposable syringe and needle 2 alcohol wipes 1 Cotton ball or gauze pad 1 Adhesive bandage Sharps disposal container Only use the disposable syringes and needles that your healthcare provider prescribes. Only use the syringes and needles 1 time. Discard (throw away) any used syringes and needles. See Step 5 Finish, for instructions about how to properly dispose of used syringes and needles. You should only use a syringe that is marked in tenths of milliliters (mL). Your healthcare provider will show you how to measure the correct dose of RELEUKO. This dose will be measured in milliliters (mL). Step 2: Get Ready D Take the cap off the vial. Clean the rubber stopper with one alcohol wipe. E Check the carton containing the syringe. If the carton has been opened or damaged, do not use that syringe. Dispose of (throw away) that syringe in the sharps disposal container. F Hold the syringe by the barrel with the needle cap pointing up. Carefully pull the needle cap straight off and away from your body. Pull back on the plunger and draw air into the syringe that is the same amount (mL) as the dose of RELEUKO that your healthcare provider prescribed. Important: Throw the needle cap into the sharps disposal container. Do not recap the needle. G Keep the vial on the flat working surface and insert the needle straight down through the rubber stopper. Do not insert the needle through the rubber stopper more than 1 time. H Push the plunger down and inject all the air from the syringe into the vial of RELEUKO. I Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down. Make sure that the RELEUKO liquid is covering the tip of the needle. J Keep the vial upside down and slowly pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe barrel with RELEUKO to the correct marking amount (mL) of medicine that matches the dose your healthcare provider prescribed. K Keep the needle in the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the syringe barrel with your finger until the air bubbles rise to the top. Slowly push the plunger up to push the air bubbles out of the syringe. L Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and again pull the plunger back to the number on the syringe barrel that matches your dose. Check again for air bubbles. The air in the syringe will not hurt you, but too large an air bubble can reduce your dose of RELEUKO. If there are still air bubbles, repeat the steps above to remove them. M Check again to make sure that you have the correct dose in the syringe. It is important that you use the exact dose prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not remove the needle from the vial. Lay the vial down on its side with the needle still in the vial. Step 3: Select and Prepare the Injection Site N Prepare and clean your injection site. You can use: Thigh Stomach area (abdomen), except for a 2 -inch area right around your navel (belly button) Upper outer area of your buttocks (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Clean your injection site with a clean alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. Do not touch this area again before injecting. If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection site area you used for a previous injection. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. Step 4: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection O Remove the prepared syringe and needle from the vial. P Pinch your injection site to create a firm surface. Important: Keep skin pinched while injecting. Q Hold the pinch. Insert the needle into the skin at a 45 to 90 degree angle. R Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger until it reaches the bottom. When done, gently pull the needle out of the injection site at the same 45 to 90 degree angle used to insert it. Step 5: Finish S Discard (throw away) the used syringe and vial. Put your used syringes, needles, and vials in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) needles, syringes and vials in your household trash. If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that: is made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, is upright and stable during use, is leak-resistant, and is properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy for AML Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day by subcutaneous injection, short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or continuous intravenous infusion. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.1 ) Patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation: 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.2 ) Patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.3 ) Administer for at least 4 days before first leukapheresis procedure and continue until last leukapheresis ( 2.3 ) Patients with congenital neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 6 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection twice daily ( 2.4 ) Patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection daily ( 2.4 ) Patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.5 ) Direct administration of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to potential for dosing errors ( 2.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy or Induction and/or Consolidation Chemotherapy for AML The recommended starting dosage of NYPOZI is 5 mcg/kg/day\u201a administered as a single daily injection by subcutaneous injection, by short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or by continuous intravenous infusion. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count before instituting NYPOZI therapy and monitor twice weekly during therapy. Consider dose escalation in increments of 5 mcg/kg for each chemotherapy cycle\u201a according to the duration and severity of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir. Recommend stopping NYPOZI if the ANC increases beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ]. Administer NYPOZI at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Do not administer NYPOZI within the 24-hour period prior to chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A transient increase in neutrophil count is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of filgrastim therapy. Therefore, to ensure a sustained therapeutic response\u201a administer NYPOZI daily for up to 2 weeks or until the ANC has reached 10\u201a000/mm 3 following the expected chemotherapy-induced neutrophil nadir. The duration of NYPOZI therapy needed to attenuate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may be dependent on the myelosuppressive potential of the chemotherapy regimen employed. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The recommended dosage of NYPOZI following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. Administer the first dose of NYPOZI at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after bone marrow infusion. Monitor CBCs and platelet counts frequently following marrow transplantation. During the period of neutrophil recovery\u201a titrate the daily dosage of NYPOZI against the neutrophil response (see Table 1 ). Table 1. Recommended Dosage Adjustments During Neutrophil Recovery in Patients with Cancer Following BMT Absolute Neutrophil Count NYPOZI Dosage Adjustment When ANC greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days Reduce to 5 mcg/kg/day If ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 at any time during the 5 mcg/kg/day administration\u201a increase NYPOZI to 10 mcg/kg/day\u201a and then follow the above steps. Then, if ANC remains greater than 1,000/ mm 3 for 3 more consecutive days Discontinue NYPOZI Then, if ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 Resume at 5 mcg/kg/day 2.3 Dosage in Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The recommended dosage of NYPOZI for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg/kg/day given by subcutaneous injection. Administer NYPOZI for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continue until the last leukapheresis. Although the optimal duration of NYPOZI administration and leukapheresis schedule have not been established\u201a administration of filgrastim for 6 to 7 days with leukaphereses on days 5\u201a 6\u201a and 7 was found to be safe and effective [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Monitor neutrophil counts after 4 days of NYPOZI and discontinue NYPOZI if the white blood cell (WBC) count rises to greater than 100\u201a000/mm 3 . 2.4 Dosage in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Prior to starting NYPOZI in patients with suspected chronic neutropenia, confirm the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) by evaluating serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts\u201a and evaluating bone marrow morphology and karyotype. The use of NYPOZI prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of SCN may impair diagnostic efforts and may thus impair or delay evaluation and treatment of an underlying condition\u201a other than SCN\u201a causing the neutropenia. The recommended starting dosage in patients with Congenital Neutropenia is 6 mcg/kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection and the recommended starting dosage in patients with Idiopathic or Cyclic Neutropenia is 5 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection. Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Chronic daily administration is required to maintain clinical benefit. Individualize the dosage based on the patient's clinical course as well as ANC. In the SCN postmarketing surveillance study, the reported median daily doses of filgrastim were: 6 mcg/kg (congenital neutropenia), 2.1 mcg/kg (cyclic neutropenia), and 1.2 mcg/kg (idiopathic neutropenia). In rare instances, patients with congenital neutropenia have required doses of filgrastim greater than or equal to 100 mcg/kg/day. Monitor CBCs for Dosage Adjustments During the initial 4 weeks of NYPOZI therapy and during the 2 weeks following any dosage adjustment\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts. Once a patient is clinically stable\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts monthly during the first year of treatment. Thereafter, if the patient is clinically stable, less frequent routine monitoring is recommended. 2.5 Dosage in Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) The recommended dose of NYPOZI is 10 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection for patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Administer NYPOZI as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation doses greater than 2 gray (Gy). Estimate a patient's absorbed radiation dose (i.e., level of radiation exposure) based on information from public health authorities, biodosimetry if available, or clinical findings such as time to onset of vomiting or lymphocyte depletion kinetics. Obtain a baseline CBC and then serial CBCs approximately every third day until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs. Do not delay administration of NYPOZI if a CBC is not readily available. Continue administration of NYPOZI until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs or exceeds 10,000/mm 3 after a radiation-induced nadir. 2.6 Important Administration Instructions NYPOZI is supplied in single-dose prefilled syringes (for subcutaneous or intravenous use) [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ] . Prior to use\u201a remove the prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow NYPOZI to reach room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 24 hours. Discard any prefilled syringe left at room temperature for greater than 24 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Do not administer NYPOZI if particulates or discoloration are observed. Discard unused portion of NYPOZI in prefilled syringes. Do not save unused drug for later administration. Subcutaneous Injection Inject NYPOZI subcutaneously in the outer area of upper arms, abdomen, thighs, or upper outer areas of the buttock. If patients or caregivers are to administer NYPOZI, instruct them in appropriate injection technique and ask them to follow the subcutaneous injection procedures in the Instructions for Use for the prefilled syringe [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ]. Training by a healthcare professional should aim to demonstrate to those patients and caregivers how to measure the dose using the prefilled syringe, and the focus should be on ensuring that a patient or caregiver can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use for the NYPOZI prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive\u2122 Needle Guard. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of NYPOZI . NYPOZI prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive\u2122 Needle Guard is not designed to allow for direct administration of doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg). The spring-mechanism of the needle guard apparatus affixed to the prefilled syringe interferes with the visibility of the graduation markings on the syringe barrel corresponding to 0.1 mL and 0.2 mL. The visibility of these markings is necessary to accurately measure doses of NYPOZI less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) for direct administration to patients. Thus, the direct administration to patients requiring doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. Dilution If required for intravenous administration, NYPOZI may be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection to a concentration of 15 mcg/mL . NYPOZI diluted to 15 mcg/mL should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by the addition of Albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. When diluted in 5% Dextrose plus Albumin (Human), NYPOZI is compatible with polyvinylchloride and polyolefin. Do not dilute with Sodium Chloride Injection at any time, because the product may precipitate. Diluted NYPOZI solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 14 hours. This 14 hour time period includes the time during room temperature storage of the infusion solution and the duration of the infusion. If the patient or caregiver misses a dose of NYPOZI, instruct them to contact their healthcare provider."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal splenic rupture: Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. ( 5.1 ) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NYPOZI in patients with ARDS. ( 5.2 ) Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis: Permanently discontinue NYPOZI in patients with serious allergic reactions. ( 5.3 ) Fatal sickle cell crises: Discontinue NYPOZI if sickle cell crisis occurs. ( 5.4 ) Glomerulonephritis: Evaluate and consider dose-reduction or interruption of NYPOZI if causality is likely. ( 5.5 ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): Monitor patients with breast and lung cancer using NYPOZI in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML. ( 5.8 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts. ( 5.9 ) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, has been reported following the administration of filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NYPOZI in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. Provide symptomatic treatment for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients receiving filgrastim products can recur within days after the discontinuation of initial anti-allergic treatment. Permanently discontinue NYPOZI in patients with serious allergic reactions. NYPOZI is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. 5.4 Sickle Cell Disorders Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur, in patients with sickle cell disorders receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue NYPOZI if sickle cell crisis occurs. 5.5 Glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis has occurred in patients receiving filgrastim products. The diagnoses were based upon azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose-reduction or discontinuation of filgrastim products. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of NYPOZI. 5.6 Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization have been reported in healthy donors treated with filgrastim products undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection mobilization. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of filgrastim products. The use of NYPOZI for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication. 5.7 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) has been reported after G-CSF administration, including filgrastim products, and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema, and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.8 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating NYPOZI therapy. MDS and AML have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with filgrastim products for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of filgrastim products on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued filgrastim products administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia\u201a the risks and benefits of continuing NYPOZI should be carefully considered. Patients with Breast and Lung Cancer MDS and AML have been associated with the use of filgrastim products in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Monitor platelet counts. 5.10 Leukocytosis Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy White blood cell counts of 100\u201a000/mm 3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving filgrastim at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day. In patients with cancer receiving NYPOZI as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis\u201a it is recommended that NYPOZI therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10\u201a000/mm 3 after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of NYPOZI that increase the ANC beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a discontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days\u201a with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy During the period of administration of NYPOZI for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue NYPOZI if the leukocyte count rises to > 100,000/mm 3 . 5.11 Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim products. In most cases\u201a the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe. Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term filgrastim therapy. Hold NYPOZI therapy in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. NYPOZI may be started at a reduced dose when the symptoms resolve and the ANC has decreased. 5.12 Potential Effect on Malignant Cells NYPOZI is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor through which NYPOZI acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that NYPOZI acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim products in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established. When NYPOZI is used to mobilize PBPC\u201a tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied\u201a and the limited data available are inconclusive. 5.13 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended The safety and efficacy of NYPOZI given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a do not use NYPOZI in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The safety and efficacy of NYPOZI have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of NYPOZI with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5.14 Nuclear Imaging Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results. 5.15 Aortitis Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue NYPOZI if aortitis is suspected."

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Adverse reaction data below are from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with AML (Study 4) who received an induction chemotherapy regimen of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5 and up to 3 additional courses of therapy (induction 2, and consolidation 1, 2) of intravenous daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and etoposide. The safety population included 518 patients randomized to receive either 5 mcg/kg/day filgrastim (n = 257) or placebo (n = 261). The median age was 54 (range 16 to 89) years and 54% were male. Adverse reactions with \u2265 2% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to placebo included epistaxis, back pain, pain in extremity, erythema, and rash maculo-papular. Adverse events with \u2265 2% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to placebo and associated with the sequelae of the underlying malignancy or cytotoxic chemotherapy included diarrhea, constipation, and transfusion reaction. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The following adverse reaction data are from one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma receiving high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or cytarabine, and melphalan) and total body irradiation (Study 5) and one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and NHL undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (Study 6). Patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation only were included in the analysis. A total of 100 patients received either 30 mcg/kg/day as a 4-hour infusion (Study 5) or 10 mcg/kg/day or 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour infusion (Study 6) filgrastim (n = 72), no treatment control or placebo (n = 28). The median age was 30 (range 15 to 57) years, 57% were male. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included rash and hypersensitivity. Adverse reactions in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, and insomnia. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection The adverse reaction data in Table 3 are from a series of 7 trials in patients with cancer undergoing mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis. Patients (n = 166) in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 8 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dosage of filgrastim ranged between 5 to 30 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous infusion. The median age was 39 (range 15 to 67) years, and 48% were male. Table 3. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous PBPC in the Mobilization Phase (\u2265 5% Incidence in Filgrastim Patients) System Organ Class Preferred Term Mobilization Phase (N = 166) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Bone pain 30% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 16% Investigations Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 11% Nervous system disorders Headache 10% Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The following adverse reaction data were identified in a randomized, controlled study in patients with SCN receiving filgrastim (Study 7). 123 patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by subcutaneous filgrastim treatment or immediate subcutaneous filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) and 46% were male. The dosage of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dosage of filgrastim: Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dosage was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included arthralgia, bone pain, back pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, splenomegaly, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were higher in the filgrastim arm, total infection related events were lower in filgrastim treated patients), epistaxis, chest pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, and alopecia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of filgrastim products.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, including several observational studies of pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to filgrastim products and those who were unexposed, have not established an association with filgrastim products use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). Reports in the scientific literature have described transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women when administered \u2264 30 hours prior to preterm delivery (\u2264 30 weeks gestation). In animal reproduction studies, effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. No maternal or fetal effects were observed in pregnant rats at doses up to 58 times the human doses. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15- 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Several observational studies based on the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) described pregnancy outcomes in women with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) who were exposed to filgrastim products during pregnancy and women with SCN who were unexposed. No major differences were seen between treated and untreated women with respect to pregnancy outcome (including miscarriage and preterm labor), newborn complications (including birth weight), and infections. Methodological limitations of these studies include small sample size and lack of generalizability due to the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data Effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses. In pregnant rabbits showing signs of maternal toxicity, reduced embryo-fetal survival (at 20 and 80 mcg/kg/day) and increased abortions (at 80 mcg/kg/day) were observed. In pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal effects were observed at doses up to 575 mcg/kg/day, which is approximately 58 times higher than the human dose of 10 mcg/kg/day. Offspring of rats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods exhibited a delay in external differentiation and growth retardation (\u2265 20 mcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is published literature documenting transfer of filgrastim into human milk. There are a few case reports describing the use of filgrastim in breastfeeding mothers with no adverse effects noted in the infants. There are no data on the effects of filgrastim products on milk production. Other filgrastim products are secreted poorly into breast milk, and filgrastim products are not absorbed orally by neonates. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for NYPOZI and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from NYPOZI or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use NYPOZI prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive\u2122 Needle Guard may not accurately measure volumes less than 0.3 mL due to the needle spring mechanism design. Therefore, the direct administration of a volume less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a 15 pediatric patients median age 2.6 (range 1.2 \u2013 9.4) years with neuroblastoma were treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide\u201a cisplatin\u201a doxorubicin\u201a and etoposide) followed by subcutaneous filgrastim at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mcg/kg/day for 10 days (n = 5/dose) (Study 8). The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adults receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. In this population\u201a filgrastim was well tolerated. There was one report of palpable splenomegaly and one report of hepatosplenomegaly associated with filgrastim therapy; however, the only consistently reported adverse event was musculoskeletal pain\u201a which is no different from the experience in the adult population. The safety and effectiveness of filgrastim have been established in pediatric patients with SCN [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ]. In a phase 3 study (Study 7) to assess the safety and efficacy of filgrastim in the treatment of SCN, 123 patients with a median age of 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) were studied. Of the 123 patients, 12 were infants (7 months to 2 years of age), 49 were children (2 to 12 years of age), and 9 were adolescents (12 to 16 years of age). Additional information is available from a SCN postmarketing surveillance study, which includes long-term follow-up of patients in the clinical studies and information from additional patients who entered directly into the postmarketing surveillance study. Of the 731 patients in the surveillance study, 429 were pediatric patients < 18 years of age (range 0.9 - 17) [see Indications and Usage (1.5) , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Long-term follow-up data from the postmarketing surveillance study suggest that height and weight are not adversely affected in patients who received up to 5 years of filgrastim treatment. Limited data from patients who were followed in the phase 3 study for 1.5 years did not suggest alterations in sexual maturation or endocrine function. Pediatric patients with congenital types of neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome, congenital agranulocytosis, or Schwachman-Diamond syndrome) have developed cytogenetic abnormalities and have undergone transformation to MDS and AML while receiving chronic filgrastim treatment. The relationship of these events to filgrastim products administration is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) , Adverse Reactions (6) ] . The use of filgrastim to increase survival in pediatric patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation is based on studies of filgrastim conducted in animals and clinical data supporting the use of filgrastim in other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 to 2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6) ]. 8.5 Geriatric Use Among 855 subjects enrolled in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of filgrastim treated-patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there were 232 subjects age 65 or older, and 22 subjects age 75 or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Clinical studies of filgrastim in other approved indications (i.e., BMT recipients, PBPC mobilization, and SCN) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects."

      "8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, including several observational studies of pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to filgrastim products and those who were unexposed, have not established an association with filgrastim products use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes ( see Data ). Reports in the scientific literature have described transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women when administered \u2264 30 hours prior to preterm delivery (\u2264 30 weeks gestation). In animal reproduction studies, effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. No maternal or fetal effects were observed in pregnant rats at doses up to 58 times the human doses. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses ( see Data ). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15- 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Several observational studies based on the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) described pregnancy outcomes in women with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) who were exposed to filgrastim products during pregnancy and women with SCN who were unexposed. No major differences were seen between treated and untreated women with respect to pregnancy outcome (including miscarriage and preterm labor), newborn complications (including birth weight), and infections. Methodological limitations of these studies include small sample size and lack of generalizability due to the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data Effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses.

      "11 DESCRIPTION Filgrastim-txid, a leukocyte growth factor, is a 175 amino acid human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Filgrastim-txid is produced by Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) bacteria into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gene. Filgrastim-txid has a molecular weight of 18\u201a800 daltons. The protein has an amino acid sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human DNA sequence analysis\u201a except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for expression in E. coli . Because filgrastim-txid is produced in E. coli \u201a the product is non-glycosylated and thus differs from G-CSF isolated from a human cell. NYPOZI (filgrastim-txid) injection is a sterile\u201a clear\u201a colorless to slightly yellowish\u201a preservative-free liquid containing filgrastim-txid at a specific activity of 1.3 \u00b1 0.3 \u00d7 10 8 IU/mg (as measured by a cell mitogenesis assay). The product is available in single-dose prefilled syringes for subcutaneous or intravenous use. The single-dose prefilled syringes contain either 300 mcg/0.5 mL or 480 mcg/0.8 mL of filgrastim-txid. The pH is 4.0.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation\u201a differentiation commitment\u201a and some end-cell functional activation. Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes\u201a fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation\u201a differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability\u201a priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst\u201a antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies\u201a administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily), subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)\u201a or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy\u201a neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro . The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however, the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer. White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift), including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts\u201a usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition\u201a Dohle bodies\u201a increased granulocyte granulation\u201a and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Filgrastim products exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is dependent on filgrastim product concentration and neutrophil count: G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance is saturated by high concentration of filgrastim products and is diminished by neutropenia. In addition, filgrastim products are cleared by the kidney. Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL\u201a respectively\u201a within 2 to 8 hours. After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution averaged 150 mL/kg and the elimination half-life was approximately 3.5 hours in both normal subjects and subjects with cancer. Clearance rate of filgrastim was approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/minute/kg. Single parenteral doses or daily intravenous doses\u201a over a 14-day period\u201a resulted in comparable half-lives. The half-lives were similar for intravenous administration (231 minutes\u201a following doses of 34.5 mcg/kg) and for subcutaneous administration (210 minutes\u201a following filgrastim dosages of 3.45 mcg/kg). Continuous 24 hour intravenous infusions of 20 mcg/kg over an 11 to 20 day period produced steady state serum concentrations of filgrastim with no evidence of drug accumulation over the time period investigated. The absolute bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60% to 70%. Specific Populations Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products is not available in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Based on limited pharmacokinetics data in irradiated non-human primates, the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), reflecting the exposure to filgrastim in non-human primates at 10 mcg/kg dose of filgrastim, appears to be similar to that in humans at 5 mcg/kg. Simulations conducted using the population pharmacokinetic model indicates that the exposures to filgrastim at a filgrastim dose of 10 mcg/kg in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation are expected to exceed the exposures at a dose of 10 mcg/kg in irradiated non-human primates. Pediatric Patient s: The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adult patients receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Renal Impairmen t: In a study with healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects with end stage renal disease (n=4 per group), higher serum concentrations were observed in subjects with end-stage renal disease. However, dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary . Hepatic Impairment : Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of filgrastim are similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n = 12/group). The study included 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Therefore, NYPOZI dose adjustment in patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of filgrastim or of other filgrastim products. While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim products, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies using filgrastim, the incidence of antibodies binding to filgrastim was 3% (11/333). In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell based bioassay. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of filgrastim products is unknown. Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors."

In Study 1, patients received up to 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy including intravenous cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin on day 1; and etoposide on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21-day cycles. Patients were randomized to receive filgrastim (n=99) at a dose of 230 mcg/m 2 (4 to 8 mcg/kg/day) or placebo (n=111). Study drug was administered subcutaneously daily beginning on day 4, for a maximum of 14 days. A total of 210 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 207 were evaluable for safety. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 62 (range 31 to 80) years; 64% males; 89% Caucasian; 72% extensive disease, and 28% limited disease. The main efficacy endpoint was the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 1000/mm 3 and temperature > 38.2\u00b0C. Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia, 40% for filgrastim-treated patients and 76% for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). There were also statistically significant reductions in the incidence and overall duration of infection manifested by febrile neutropenia; the incidence, severity and duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ); the incidence and overall duration of hospital admissions; and the number of reported days of antibiotic use. 14.2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was established in a randomized, double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled\u201a multi-center trial in patients with newly diagnosed, de novo AML (Study 4). In Study 4 the initial induction therapy consisted of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous filgrastim (n=259) at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day or placebo (n=262) from 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC \u22651000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days or \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 54 (range 16 to 89) years; 54% males; initial white blood cell count (65% - <25,000 /mm 3 and 27% > 100,000/mm 3 ); 29% unfavorable cytogenetics. The main efficacy endpoint was median duration of severe neutropenia defined as neutrophil count < 500/mm 3 . Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in median number of days of severe neutropenia, filgrastim-treated patients 14 days, placebo-treated patients 19 days (p = 0.0001: difference of 5 days (95% CI: -6.0, -4.0)). There was a reduction in the median duration of intravenous antibiotic use, filgrastim-treated patients: 15 days versus placebo-treated patients: 18.5 days; a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization, filgrastim-treated patients: 20 days versus placebo-treated patients: 25 days. There were no statistically significant differences between the filgrastim and the placebo groups in complete remission rate (69% - filgrastim, 68% - placebo), median time to progression of all randomized patients (165 days - filgrastim, 186 days - placebo), or median overall survival (380 days - filgrastim, 425 days - placebo). 14.3 Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in 2 randomized controlled trials of patients with lymphoma (Study 6 and Study 9). The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial (Study10). In Study 6 patients with Hodgkin's disease received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\"CVP\"), and patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\"BEAM\"). There were 54 patients randomized 1:1:1 to control, filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day, and filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour continuous infusion starting 24 hours after bone marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 57) years; 56% males; 69% Hodgkin's disease and 31% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia ANC < 500/mm 3 . A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) occurred in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (23 days in the control group\u201a 11 days in the 10 mcg/kg/day group\u201a and 14 days in the 30 mcg/kg/day group [11 days in the combined treatment groups\u201a p = 0.004]). In Study 9, patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received a preparative regimen intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\"CVP\"). There were 43 evaluable patients randomized to continuous subcutaneous infusion filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day (n=19), filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day (n=10) and no treatment (n=14) starting the day after marrow infusion for maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 56) years; 67% males; 28% Hodgkin's disease and 72% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia. There was statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (21.5 days in the control group versus 10 days in the filgrastim-treated groups, p < 0.001). The number of days of febrile neutropenia was also reduced significantly in this study (13.5 days in the control group versus 5 days in the filgrastim-treated groups\u201a p < 0.0001). In Study 10, 70 patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplantation for multiple underlying conditions using multiple preparative regimens were randomized to receive filgrastim 300 mcg/m 2 /day (n=33) or placebo (n=37) days 5 through 28 after marrow infusion. The median age was 18 (range 1 to 45) years, 56% males. The underlying disease was: 67% hematologic malignancy, 24% aplastic anemia, 9% other. A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia occurred in the treated group versus the control group (19 days in the control group and 15 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001) and time to recovery of ANC to \u2265 500/mm 3 (21 days in the control group and 16 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001). 14.4 Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to mobilize autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis was supported by the experience in uncontrolled trials, and a randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell rescue using filgrastim mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells to autologous bone marrow (Study 11). Patients in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 7 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dose of filgrastim ranged between 10 to 24 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Engraftment was evaluated in 64 patients who underwent transplantation using filgrastim mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells in uncontrolled trials. Two of the 64 patients (3%) did not achieve the criteria for engraftment as defined by a platelet count \u2265 20\u201a000/mm 3 by day 28. In clinical trials of filgrastim for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells\u201a filgrastim was administered to patients at doses between 5 to 24 mcg/kg/day after reinfusion of the collected cells until a sustainable ANC (\u2265 500/mm 3 ) was reached. The rate of engraftment of these cells in the absence of filgrastim post transplantation has not been studied. Study 11 was a randomized, unblinded study of patients with Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy\u201a 27 patients received filgrastim-mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells and 31 patients received autologous bone marrow. The preparative regimen was intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\"BEAM\"). Patients received daily filgrastim 24 hours after stem cell infusion at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day. The median age was 33 (range 1 to 59) years; 64% males; 57% Hodgkin's disease and 43% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was number of days of platelet transfusions. Patients randomized to filgrastim-mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells compared to autologous bone marrow had significantly fewer days of platelet transfusions (median 6 vs 10 days). 14.5 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of neutropenia (that is fever\u201a infections, oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic adult and pediatric patients with congenital neutropenia\u201a cyclic neutropenia\u201a or idiopathic neutropenia was established in a randomized controlled trial conducted in patients with severe neutropenia (Study 7). Patients eligible for Study 7 had a history of severe chronic neutropenia documented with an ANC < 500/mm 3 on three occasions during a 6-month period, or in patients with cyclic neutropenia 5 consecutive days of ANC < 500/mm 3 per cycle. In addition, patients must have experienced a clinically significant infection during the previous 12 months. Patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by filgrastim treatment or immediate filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years); 46% males; 34% idiopathic, 17% cyclic, and 49% congenital neutropenia. Filgrastim was administered subcutaneously. The dose of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dose of filgrastim: Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dose was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. The main efficacy endpoint was response to filgrastim treatment. ANC response from baseline (< 500/mm 3 ) was defined as follows: Complete response: median ANC > 1500/mm 3 Partial response: median ANC \u2265 500/mm 3 and \u2264 1500/mm 3 with a minimum increase of 100% No response: median ANC < 500/mm 3 There were 112 of 123 patients who demonstrated a complete or partial response to filgrastim treatment. Additional efficacy endpoints included a comparison between patients randomized to 4 months of observation and patients receiving filgrastim of the following parameters: incidence of infection incidence of fever duration of fever incidence, duration, and severity of oropharyngeal ulcers number of days of antibiotic use The incidence for each of these 5 clinical parameters was lower in the filgrastim arm compared to the control arm for cohorts in each of the 3 major diagnostic categories. An analysis of variance showed no significant interaction between treatment and diagnosis\u201a suggesting that efficacy did not differ substantially in the different diseases. Although filgrastim substantially reduced neutropenia in all patient groups\u201a in patients with cyclic neutropenia\u201a cycling persisted but the period of neutropenia was shortened to 1 day. 14.6 Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) Efficacy studies of filgrastim products could not be conducted in humans with acute radiation syndrome for ethical and feasibility reasons. Approval of this indication was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals and data supporting the use of filgrastim for other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 to 2.4) ] . Because of the uncertainty associated with extrapolating animal efficacy data to humans, the selection of human dose for NYPOZI is aimed at providing exposures to filgrastim that exceed those observed in animal efficacy studies. The 10 mcg/kg daily dose is selected for humans exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation because the exposure associated with such a dose is expected to exceed the exposure associated with a 10 mcg/kg dose in non-human primates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety of filgrastim at a daily dose of 10 mcg/kg has been assessed on the basis of clinical experience in approved indications. The efficacy of filgrastim was studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in a non-human primate model of radiation injury. The planned sample size was 62 animals, but the study was stopped at the interim analysis with 46 animals because efficacy was established. Rhesus macaques were randomized to a control (n = 22) or treated (n = 24) group. Animals were exposed to total body irradiation of 7.4 \u00b1 0.15 Gy delivered at 0.8 \u00b1 0.03 Gy/min, representing a dose that would be lethal in 50% of animals by 60 days of follow-up (LD50/60). Starting on day 1 after irradiation, animals received daily subcutaneous injections of placebo (5% dextrose in water) or filgrastim (10 mcg/kg/day). Blinded treatment was stopped when one of the following criteria was met: ANC \u2265 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for more than 2 consecutive days within study day 1 to 5, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 any time after study day 5. Animals received medical management consisting of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, blood transfusions, and other support as required. Filgrastim significantly (at 0.023 level of significance) reduced 60-day mortality in the irradiated non-human primates: 21% mortality (5/24) in the filgrastim group compared to 59% mortality (13/22) in the control group."

      "Patient Information NYPOZI\u2122 (ni-poz-ee) (filgrastim-txid) injection This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Issued: June 2024 What is NYPOZI? NYPOZI is a man-made form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is a substance produced by the body. It stimulates the growth of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important in the body's fight against infection. Acute Radiation Syndrome: The effectiveness of filgrastim for this use was only studied in animals, because it could not be studied in people. Do not take NYPOZI if you have had a serious allergic reaction to human G-CSFs such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. Before you take NYPOZI, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have a sickle cell disorder. have kidney problems. are receiving radiation therapy. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if NYPOZI will harm your unborn baby. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if NYPOZI passes into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How will I receive NYPOZI? NYPOZI injections can be given by a healthcare provider by intravenous (IV) infusion or under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Your healthcare provider may decide subcutaneous injections can be given at home by you or your caregiver. If NYPOZI is given at home, see the detailed \" Instructions for Use \" that comes with your NYPOZI for information on how to prepare and inject a dose of NYPOZI. You and your caregiver should be shown how to prepare and inject NYPOZI before you use it, by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much NYPOZI to inject and when to inject it. Do not change your dose or stop NYPOZI unless your healthcare provider tells you to. You should not inject a dose of NYPOZI less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) from a NYPOZI prefilled syringe. A dose less than 0.3 mL cannot be accurately measured using the NYPOZI prefilled syringe. If you are receiving NYPOZI because you are also receiving chemotherapy, your dose of NYPOZI should be injected at least 24 hours before or 24 hours after your dose of chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to monitor your white blood cell counts, and if necessary, adjust your NYPOZI dose. If you are receiving NYPOZI because you have been suddenly (acutely) exposed to an amount of radiation that can affect your bone marrow (Acute Radiation Syndrome), you will need to have blood tests about every 3 days during treatment with NYPOZI to check your white blood cell count. If you miss a dose of NYPOZI, talk to your healthcare provider about when you should give your next dose. What are the possible side effects of NYPOZI? NYPOZI may cause serious side effects, including: Spleen rupture. Your spleen may become enlarged and can rupture. A ruptured spleen can cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in the left upper stomach (abdomen) area or your left shoulder. A serious lung problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if you have shortness of breath with or without a fever, trouble breathing, or a fast rate of breathing. Serious allergic reactions. NYPOZI can cause serious allergic reactions. These reactions can cause a rash over your whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling around your mouth or eyes, fast heart rate, and sweating. If you have any of these symptoms, stop using NYPOZI and call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away. Sickle cell crises. You may have a serious sickle cell crisis, which could lead to death, if you have a sickle cell disorder and receive NYPOZI. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of sickle cell crisis such as pain or difficulty breathing. Kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). NYPOZI can cause kidney injury. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: swelling of your face or ankles blood in your urine or dark colored urine you urinate less than usual Capillary leak syndrome. NYPOZI can cause fluid to leak from blood vessels into your body's tissues. This condition is called \"Capillary Leak Syndrome\" (CLS). CLS can quickly cause you to have symptoms that may become life-threatening. Get emergency medical help right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: swelling or puffiness and are urinating less than usual trouble breathing swelling of your stomach-area (abdomen) and feeling of fullness dizziness or feeling faint a general feeling of tiredness Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . NYPOZI may increase the risk of developing a precancerous condition called MDS or a type of blood cancer called AML in people who were born with low white blood cell counts (congenital neutropenia). If you have breast cancer or lung cancer, when NYPOZI is used with chemotherapy and radiation therapy or with radiation therapy only, you may have an increased risk of developing MDS or AML. Symptoms of MDS and AML may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. Call your healthcare provider if you develop any of these symptoms during treatment with NYPOZI. Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with NYPOZI. Tell your healthcare provider if you have unusual bleeding or bruising during treatment with NYPOZI. This could be a sign of decreased platelet counts, which may reduce the ability of your blood to clot. Increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with NYPOZI. Inflammation of your blood vessels (cutaneous vasculitis). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop purple spots or redness of your skin. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis). Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported in patients who received filgrastim products. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, feeling tired, and back pain. Call your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms. The most common side effects experienced in patients receiving NYPOZI include: Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy: fever, pain, rash, cough, and shortness of breath Patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy: pain, nose bleed, and rash Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant: rash Patients who are having their own blood cells collected: bone pain, fever, and headache Patients with severe chronic neutropenia: pain, decreased red blood cells, nose bleed, diarrhea, reduced sensation, and hair loss These are not all the possible side effects of NYPOZI. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store NYPOZI? Store NYPOZI in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Keep NYPOZI in the original carton to protect it from light or physical damage. Do not leave NYPOZI in direct sunlight. Do not shake NYPOZI. Take NYPOZI out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. If not used right away, the prefilled syringe may be kept at room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) for up to 24 hours. Throw away (dispose of) any NYPOZI that has been left at room temperature for more than 24 hours. After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused NYPOZI left in the prefilled syringe. Do not save unused NYPOZI in the prefilled syringe for later use. Keep NYPOZI and all medicines out of the reach of children. General information about the safe and effective use of NYPOZI: Medicines are sometimes prescribed for purposes other than those listed in a Patient Information leaflet. Do not use NYPOZI for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give NYPOZI to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about NYPOZI that is written for health professionals. What are the ingredients in NYPOZI?

      "Instructions for Use NYPOZI\u2122 (ni-poz-ee) (filgrastim-txid) injection Single-Dose Prefilled Syringe Guide to Parts Important: The needle is covered by the gray needle cap before use. Important Read the Patient Information for important information you need to know about NYPOZI before using these Instructions for Use. Before you use a NYPOZI prefilled syringe, read this important information. Storing your NYPOZI prefilled syringe Store the NYPOZI prefilled syringe in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze NYPOZI prefilled syringes. Keep the prefilled syringe in the original carton to protect it from light or physical damage. Take the prefilled syringe out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. Throw away (dispose of) any prefilled syringe that has been left at room temperature for longer than 24 hours. After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused NYPOZI left in the prefilled syringe. Do not save unused NYPOZI in the prefilled syringe for later use. Keep the NYPOZI prefilled syringe out of the reach of children. Using your prefilled syringe It is important that you do not try to give the injection unless you or your caregiver has received training from your healthcare provider. Make sure the name NYPOZI appears on the carton and prefilled syringe label. Do not inject a dose of NYPOZI less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) from a NYPOZI prefilled syringe. A dose less than 0.3 mL cannot be accurately measured using the NYPOZI prefilled syringe. Do not use a prefilled syringe after the expiration date on the label. Do not shake the prefilled syringe. Do not remove the gray needle cap from the prefilled syringe until you are ready to inject. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the carton is open or damaged. Do not use a prefilled syringe if it has been dropped on a hard surface. The prefilled syringe may be broken even if you cannot see the break. Use a new prefilled syringe. The prefilled syringe has a needle guard that will be activated to cover the needle after the injection is given. The needle guard will help prevent needle stick injuries to anyone who handles the prefilled syringe. Avoid touching the syringe needle guard wings before use. Touching them may cause the syringe needle guard to be activated too early. Use another prefilled syringe that has not been activated and is ready to use. Call your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Step 1: Prepare A Remove the prefilled syringe carton from the refrigerator. Put the original carton with any unused prefilled syringes back in the refrigerator. Remove the syringe blister pack from the carton. On a clean, well-lit, flat surface, place the syringe blister pack at room temperature for 30 minutes before you give an injection. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the carton is damaged. Do not try to warm the prefilled syringe by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. Keep the prefilled syringe in the blister pack until you are ready to use it. Do not leave the prefilled syringe in direct sunlight. Do not shake the prefilled syringe. Open the blister pack by peeling away the cover. Grab the transparent needle guard to remove the prefilled syringe from the blister pack. For safety reasons: Do not grab the plunger rod. Do not grab the gray needle cap. B Inspect the medicine and prefilled syringe. Turn the prefilled syringe so you can see through the viewing window and dose markings. Make sure the medicine in the prefilled syringe is clear and colorless to slightly yellowish. Check to make sure that the plastic transparent needle guard is covering the barrel of the glass syringe. If the transparent needle guard is covering the gray needle cap (shown below), the needle guard has already been activated. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the needle guard has been activated . Syringe with Activated Needle Guard Do not use the prefilled syringe if: The medicine is cloudy or discolored or contains flakes or particles. Any part appears cracked or broken. The prefilled syringe has been dropped. The gray needle cap is missing or not securely attached. The expiration date printed on the label has passed. In all cases, use a new prefilled syringe and call your healthcare provider. C Gather all materials needed for injection. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. On a clean, well-lit work surface, place the: Prefilled syringe, and the following items, that are not included in the NYPOZI carton Alcohol wipe Cotton ball or gauze pad Adhesive bandage Sharps disposal container or other appropriate disposal container Step 2: Get ready D Prepare and clean your injection site You can use: Thigh Stomach area (abdomen), except for a 2 -inch area right around your navel (belly button) Upper outer area of your buttocks (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. Do not touch this cleansed area again before injecting. If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection site area you used for a previous injection. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. E Hold the prefilled syringe by the syringe barrel (the clear plastic needle guard) with the needle pointing up . Carefully pull the gray needle cap straight off and away from your body. Do not remove the gray needle cap from the prefilled syringe until you are ready to inject. Do not twist or bend the gray needle cap. Do not hold the prefilled syringe by the plunger rod. Do not put the gray needle cap back onto the prefilled syringe. Important: Throw away the gray needle cap into the sharps or other appropriate disposal container. F Check your prescription before you inject your dose Your healthcare provider has prescribed either a \"full\" syringe dose or a \"partial\" syringe dose of NYPOZI. If you are prescribed a full dose, you will inject all of the medicine from your prefilled syringe. For a full dose, go directly to Step 3: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. If you are prescribed a partial dose of NYPOZI, start with Step G below. G Check the syringe for an air bubble. Point the needle up and gently tap the syringe with your fingers until the air bubble rises to the top of the syringe. H Hold the syringe as shown below and press slowly on the plunger to push out the excess medicine until the top edge of the conical base of the plunger stopper lines up with the syringe marking for your prescribed dose. As you push the plunger rod up, air and extra medication is removed. Check to make sure the plunger lines up with the syringe markings for your prescribed dose. If you remove too much medicine, get a new prefilled syringe and start again at Step 1. See the figure below ( Step 2 ) for an example of a dose of 0.4 mL. Your dose may be different than the example shown. Call your healthcare provider if you have problems measuring your prescribed dose. Step 3: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection I With one hand gently pinch the skin at the injection site to create a firm surface. Important: Keep the skin pinched while injecting. J Hold the pinch. With your other hand insert the needle into the skin at a 45 to 90 degree angle as shown . K Using slow and constant pressure, slowly press down on the plunger rod as far as it will go so that the plunger head is completely between the needle guard wings. Do not pull back the plunger rod while the needle is inserted. When done, keep the plunger fully pressed down while you carefully pull the needle straight out from the injection site . Important: When you remove the syringe, if it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, this means you have not received a full dose. Call your healthcare provider right away. Step 4: Finish L Before you finish! Slowly release the plunger and allow the needle guard to automatically cover the exposed needle. Keep your hands away from the needle at all times. M Discard (throw away) your used prefilled syringe. Put the used prefilled syringe in a FDA-cleared sharps or other appropriate disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) your NYPOZI prefilled syringe in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and prefilled syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not reuse the prefilled syringe. Do not recycle the prefilled syringe or sharps disposal container or throw them into household trash. Important: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children. N Examine the injection site. If there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. Apply an adhesive bandage if needed. tanvex NYPOZI \u2122 (filgrastim-txid) Injection Manufactured by: Tanvex BioPharma USA, Inc., San Diego, CA 92121 Product of USA US License No. 2259 This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy for AML Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection, short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or continuous intravenous infusion. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.1 ) Patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.2 ) Patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.3 ) Administer for at least 4 days before first leukapheresis procedure and continue until last leukapheresis ( 2.3 ) Patients with congenital neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 6 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection twice daily ( 2.4 ) Patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection daily ( 2.4 ) Patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy or Induction and/or Consolidation Chemotherapy for AML The recommended starting dosage of NEUPOGEN is 5 mcg/kg/day\u201a administered as a single daily injection by subcutaneous injection\u201a by short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes)\u201a or by continuous intravenous infusion. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count before instituting NEUPOGEN therapy and monitor twice weekly during therapy. Consider dose escalation in increments of 5 mcg/kg for each chemotherapy cycle\u201a according to the duration and severity of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir. Recommend stopping NEUPOGEN if the ANC increases beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Administer NEUPOGEN at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Do not administer NEUPOGEN within the 24-hour period prior to chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A transient increase in neutrophil count is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of NEUPOGEN therapy. Therefore, to ensure a sustained therapeutic response\u201a administer NEUPOGEN daily for up to 2 weeks or until the ANC has reached 10\u201a000/mm 3 following the expected chemotherapy-induced neutrophil nadir. The duration of NEUPOGEN therapy needed to attenuate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may be dependent on the myelosuppressive potential of the chemotherapy regimen employed. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The recommended dosage of NEUPOGEN following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. Administer the first dose of NEUPOGEN at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after bone marrow infusion. Monitor CBCs and platelet counts frequently following marrow transplantation. During the period of neutrophil recovery\u201a titrate the daily dosage of NEUPOGEN against the neutrophil response (see Table 1 ) . Table 1. Recommended Dosage Adjustments During Neutrophil Recovery in Patients with Cancer Following BMT Absolute Neutrophil Count NEUPOGEN Dosage Adjustment When ANC greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days Reduce to 5 mcg/kg/day If ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 at any time during the 5 mcg/kg/day administration\u201a increase NEUPOGEN to 10 mcg/kg/day\u201a and then follow the above steps. Then, if ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 more consecutive days Discontinue NEUPOGEN Then, if ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 Resume at 5 mcg/kg/day 2.3 Dosage in Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The recommended dosage of NEUPOGEN for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg/kg/day given by subcutaneous injection. Administer NEUPOGEN for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continue until the last leukapheresis. Although the optimal duration of NEUPOGEN administration and leukapheresis schedule have not been established\u201a administration of NEUPOGEN for 6 to 7 days with leukaphereses on days 5\u201a 6\u201a and 7 was found to be safe and effective [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Monitor neutrophil counts after 4 days of NEUPOGEN\u201a and discontinue NEUPOGEN if the white blood cell (WBC) count rises to greater than 100\u201a000/mm 3 . 2.4 Dosage in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Prior to starting NEUPOGEN in patients with suspected chronic neutropenia, confirm the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) by evaluating serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts\u201a and evaluating bone marrow morphology and karyotype. The use of NEUPOGEN prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of SCN may impair diagnostic efforts and may thus impair or delay evaluation and treatment of an underlying condition\u201a other than SCN\u201a causing the neutropenia. The recommended starting dosage in patients with Congenital Neutropenia is 6 mcg/kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection and the recommended starting dosage in patients with Idiopathic or Cyclic Neutropenia is 5 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection. Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Chronic daily administration is required to maintain clinical benefit. Individualize the dosage based on the patient's clinical course as well as ANC. In the SCN postmarketing surveillance study, the reported median daily doses of NEUPOGEN were: 6 mcg/kg (congenital neutropenia), 2.1 mcg/kg (cyclic neutropenia), and 1.2 mcg/kg (idiopathic neutropenia). In rare instances, patients with congenital neutropenia have required doses of NEUPOGEN greater than or equal to 100 mcg/kg/day. Monitor CBCs for Dosage Adjustments During the initial 4 weeks of NEUPOGEN therapy and during the 2 weeks following any dosage adjustment\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts. Once a patient is clinically stable\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts monthly during the first year of treatment. Thereafter, if the patient is clinically stable, less frequent routine monitoring is recommended. 2.5 Dosage in Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) The recommended dose of NEUPOGEN is 10 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection for patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Administer NEUPOGEN as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation doses greater than 2 gray (Gy). Estimate a patient's absorbed radiation dose (i.e., level of radiation exposure) based on information from public health authorities, biodosimetry if available, or clinical findings such as time to onset of vomiting or lymphocyte depletion kinetics. Obtain a baseline CBC and then serial CBCs approximately every third day until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs. Do not delay administration of NEUPOGEN if a CBC is not readily available. Continue administration of NEUPOGEN until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs or exceeds 10,000/mm 3 after a radiation-induced nadir. 2.6 Important Administration Instructions NEUPOGEN is supplied in single-dose vials (for subcutaneous use or intravenous infusion) and single-dose prefilled syringes (for subcutaneous use) [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ] . Prior to use\u201a remove the vial or prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow NEUPOGEN to reach room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and a maximum of 24 hours. Discard any vial or prefilled syringe left at room temperature for greater than 24 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (the solution is clear and colorless). Do not administer NEUPOGEN if particulates or discoloration are observed. Discard unused portion of NEUPOGEN in vials or prefilled syringes; do not re-enter the vial. Do not save unused drug for later administration. Subcutaneous Injection Inject NEUPOGEN subcutaneously in the outer area of upper arms, abdomen, thighs, or upper outer areas of the buttock. If patients or caregivers are to administer NEUPOGEN, instruct them in appropriate injection technique and ask them to follow the subcutaneous injection procedures in the Instructions for Use for the vial or prefilled syringe [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Training by the healthcare provider should aim to demonstrate to those patients and caregivers how to measure the dose of NEUPOGEN, and the focus should be on ensuring that a patient or caregiver can successfully perform all the steps in the Instructions for Use for the vial or prefilled syringe. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of NEUPOGEN or whether the patient would benefit from a different NEUPOGEN presentation. If a patient or caregiver experiences difficulty measuring the required dose, especially if it is other than the entire contents of the NEUPOGEN prefilled syringe, use of the NEUPOGEN vial may be considered. If the patient or caregiver misses a dose of NEUPOGEN, instruct them to contact their healthcare provider. Administration Instructions for the Prefilled Syringe Persons with latex allergies should not administer the NEUPOGEN prefilled syringe, because the needle cap contains dry natural rubber (derived from latex). Administration Instructions for Dilution (Vial Only) If required for intravenous administration\u201a NEUPOGEN (vial only) may be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP from a concentration of 300 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/mL (do not dilute to a final concentration less than 5 mcg/mL). NEUPOGEN diluted to concentrations from 5 mcg/mL to 15 mcg/mL should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by the addition of Albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. When diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose plus Albumin (Human)\u201a NEUPOGEN is compatible with glass bottles\u201a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyolefin intravenous bags\u201a and polypropylene syringes. Do not dilute with saline at any time because the product may precipitate. Diluted NEUPOGEN solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours. This 24-hour time period includes the time during room temperature storage of the infusion solution and the duration of the infusion."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Fatal splenic rupture: Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. ( 5.1 ) Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS): Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NEUPOGEN in patients with ARDS. ( 5.2 ) Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis: Permanently discontinue NEUPOGEN in patients with serious allergic reactions. ( 5.3 ) Fatal sickle cell crises: Discontinue NEUPOGEN if sickle cell crisis occurs. ( 5.4 ) Glomerulonephritis: Evaluate and consider dose-reduction or interruption of NEUPOGEN if causality is likely. ( 5.5 ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): Monitor patients with breast and lung cancer using NEUPOGEN in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML. ( 5.8 ) Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts. ( 5.9 ) Aortitis: Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. Discontinue NEUPOGEN if aortitis is suspected. ( 5.15 ) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, has been reported following the administration of NEUPOGEN. Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NEUPOGEN in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. Provide symptomatic treatment for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients receiving NEUPOGEN can recur within days after the discontinuation of initial anti-allergic treatment. Permanently discontinue NEUPOGEN in patients with serious allergic reactions. NEUPOGEN is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. 5.4 Sickle Cell Disorders Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur in patients with sickle cell disorders receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue NEUPOGEN if sickle cell crisis occurs. 5.5 Glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis has occurred in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. The diagnoses were based upon azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose-reduction or discontinuation of NEUPOGEN. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of NEUPOGEN. 5.6 Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization have been reported in NEUPOGEN-treated healthy donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection mobilization. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of NEUPOGEN. The use of NEUPOGEN for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication. 5.7 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) has been reported after G-CSF administration, including NEUPOGEN, and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.8 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating NEUPOGEN therapy. MDS and AML have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with NEUPOGEN for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of NEUPOGEN on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued NEUPOGEN administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia\u201a the risks and benefits of continuing NEUPOGEN should be carefully considered. Patients with Breast and Lung Cancer MDS and AML have been associated with the use of NEUPOGEN in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. Monitor platelet counts. 5.10 Leukocytosis Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy White blood cell counts of 100\u201a000/mm 3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving NEUPOGEN at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day. In patients with cancer receiving NEUPOGEN as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis\u201a it is recommended that NEUPOGEN therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10\u201a000/mm 3 after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of NEUPOGEN that increase the ANC beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a discontinuation of NEUPOGEN therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days\u201a with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy During the period of administration of NEUPOGEN for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue NEUPOGEN if the leukocyte count rises to > 100,000/mm 3 . 5.11 Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with NEUPOGEN. In most cases\u201a the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe. Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term NEUPOGEN therapy. Hold NEUPOGEN therapy in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. NEUPOGEN may be started at a reduced dose when the symptoms resolve and the ANC has decreased. 5.12 Potential Effect on Malignant Cells NEUPOGEN is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor through which filgrastim acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that filgrastim acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established. When NEUPOGEN is used to mobilize PBPC\u201a tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied\u201a and the limited data available are inconclusive. 5.13 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a do not use NEUPOGEN in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of NEUPOGEN with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5.14 Nuclear Imaging Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results. 5.15 Aortitis Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving NEUPOGEN. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue NEUPOGEN if aortitis is suspected."

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Adverse reaction data below are from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with AML (Study 4) who received an induction chemotherapy regimen of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5 and up to 3 additional courses of therapy (induction 2, and consolidation 1, 2) of intravenous daunorubicin, cytosine arabinoside, and etoposide. The safety population included 518 patients randomized to receive either 5 mcg/kg/day NEUPOGEN (n = 257) or placebo (n = 261). The median age was 54 (range 16 to 89) years and 54% were male. Adverse reactions with \u2265 2% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to placebo included epistaxis, back pain, pain in extremity, erythema, and rash maculo-papular. Adverse events with \u2265 2% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to placebo and associated with the sequelae of the underlying malignancy or cytotoxic chemotherapy included diarrhea, constipation, and transfusion reaction. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The following adverse reaction data are from one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma receiving high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or cytarabine, and melphalan) and total body irradiation (Study 5) and one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and NHL undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (Study 6). Patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation only were included in the analysis. A total of 100 patients received either 30 mcg/kg/day as a 4-hour infusion (Study 5) or 10 mcg/kg/day or 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour infusion (Study 6) NEUPOGEN (n = 72), no treatment control or placebo (n = 28). The median age was 30 (range 15 to 57) years, 57% were male. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to patients receiving no NEUPOGEN included rash and hypersensitivity. Adverse reactions in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT with \u2265 5% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to patients receiving no NEUPOGEN included thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, and insomnia. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection The adverse reaction data in Table 3 are from a series of 7 trials in patients with cancer undergoing mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis. Patients (n = 166) in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: NEUPOGEN was administered for 6 to 8 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dosage of NEUPOGEN ranged between 5 to 30 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous infusion. The median age was 39 (range 15 to 67) years, and 48% were male. Table 3. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous PBPC in the Mobilization Phase (\u2265 5% Incidence in NEUPOGEN Patients) System Organ Class Preferred Term Mobilization Phase (N = 166) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Bone pain 30% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 16% Investigations Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 11% Nervous system disorders Headache 10% Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The following adverse reaction data were identified in a randomized, controlled study in patients with SCN receiving NEUPOGEN (Study 7). 123 patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by subcutaneous NEUPOGEN treatment or immediate subcutaneous NEUPOGEN treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) and 46% were male. The dosage of NEUPOGEN was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dosage of NEUPOGEN: Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dosage was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in NEUPOGEN patients compared to patients receiving no NEUPOGEN included arthralgia, bone pain, back pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, splenomegaly, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were higher in the NEUPOGEN arm, total infection related events were lower in NEUPOGEN-treated patients), epistaxis, chest pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, and alopecia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of NEUPOGEN.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, including several observational studies of pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to filgrastim products and those who were unexposed, have not established an association with NEUPOGEN use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . Reports in the scientific literature have described transplacental passage of NEUPOGEN in pregnant women when administered \u2264 30 hours prior to preterm delivery (\u2264 30 weeks gestation). In animal reproduction studies, effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. No maternal or fetal effects were observed in pregnant rats at doses up to 58 times the human doses. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Data Human Data Several observational studies based on the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) described pregnancy outcomes in women with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) who were exposed to filgrastim products during pregnancy and women with SCN who were unexposed. No major differences were seen between treated and untreated women with respect to pregnancy outcome (including miscarriage and preterm labor), newborn complications (including birth weight), and infections. Methodological limitations of these studies include small sample size and lack of generalizability due to the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data Effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses. In pregnant rabbits showing signs of maternal toxicity, reduced embryo-fetal survival (at 20 and 80 mcg/kg/day) and increased abortions (at 80 mcg/kg/day) were observed. In pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal effects were observed at doses up to 575 mcg/kg/day, which is approximately 58 times higher than the human dose of 10 mcg/kg/day. Offspring of rats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods exhibited a delay in external differentiation and growth retardation (\u2265 20 mcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is published literature documenting transfer of filgrastim into human milk. There are a few case reports describing the use of filgrastim in breastfeeding mothers with no adverse effects noted in the infants. There are no data on the effects of filgrastim on milk production. Other filgrastim products are secreted poorly into breast milk, and filgrastim products are not absorbed orally by neonates. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for NEUPOGEN and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from NEUPOGEN or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a 15 pediatric patients median age 2.6 (range 1.2 to 9.4) years with neuroblastoma were treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide\u201a cisplatin\u201a doxorubicin\u201a and etoposide) followed by subcutaneous NEUPOGEN at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mcg/kg/day for 10 days (n = 5/dose) (Study 8). The pharmacokinetics of NEUPOGEN in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adults receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of NEUPOGEN. In this population\u201a NEUPOGEN was well tolerated. There was one report of palpable splenomegaly and one report of hepatosplenomegaly associated with NEUPOGEN therapy; however, the only consistently reported adverse event was musculoskeletal pain\u201a which is no different from the experience in the adult population. The safety and effectiveness of NEUPOGEN have been established in pediatric patients with SCN [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . In a phase 3 study (Study 7) to assess the safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN in the treatment of SCN, 123 patients with a median age of 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) were studied. Of the 123 patients, 12 were infants (7 months to 2 years of age), 49 were children (2 to 12 years of age), and 9 were adolescents (12 to 16 years of age). Additional information is available from a SCN postmarketing surveillance study, which includes long-term follow-up of patients in the clinical studies and information from additional patients who entered directly into the postmarketing surveillance study. Of the 731 patients in the surveillance study, 429 were pediatric patients < 18 years of age (range 0.9 to 17) [see Indications and Usage (1.5) , Dosage and Administration (2.6) , and Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Long-term follow-up data from the postmarketing surveillance study suggest that height and weight are not adversely affected in patients who received up to 5 years of NEUPOGEN treatment. Limited data from patients who were followed in the phase 3 study for 1.5 years did not suggest alterations in sexual maturation or endocrine function. Pediatric patients with congenital types of neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome, congenital agranulocytosis, or Schwachman-Diamond syndrome) have developed cytogenetic abnormalities and have undergone transformation to MDS and AML while receiving chronic NEUPOGEN treatment. The relationship of these events to NEUPOGEN administration is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . The use of NEUPOGEN to increase survival in pediatric patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation is based on studies conducted in animals and clinical data supporting the use of NEUPOGEN in other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 to 2.4) and Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Among 855 subjects enrolled in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of NEUPOGEN-treated patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there were 232 subjects age 65 or older, and 22 subjects age 75 or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Clinical studies of NEUPOGEN in other approved indications (i.e., BMT recipients, PBPC mobilization, and SCN) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Filgrastim is a 175 amino acid human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Filgrastim is produced by Escherichia coli (E coli) bacteria into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gene. Filgrastim has a molecular weight of 18\u201a800 daltons. The protein has an amino acid sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human DNA sequence analysis\u201a except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for expression in E coli . Because filgrastim is produced in E coli \u201a the product is non-glycosylated and thus differs from G-CSF isolated from a human cell. NEUPOGEN injection is a sterile\u201a clear\u201a colorless\u201a preservative-free liquid containing filgrastim at a specific activity of 1.0 \u00b1 0.6 \u00d7 10 8 U/mg (as measured by a cell mitogenesis assay). The product is available in single-dose vials for subcutaneous or intravenous use and prefilled syringes for subcutaneous use. The single-dose vials contain either 300 mcg/mL or 480 mcg/1.6 mL of filgrastim. The single-dose prefilled syringes contain either 300 mcg/0.5 mL or 480 mcg/0.8 mL of filgrastim. The NEUPOGEN drug product has a pH of 4.0.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation\u201a differentiation commitment\u201a and some end-cell functional activation. Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes\u201a fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation\u201a differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability\u201a priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst\u201a antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies\u201a NEUPOGEN administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether NEUPOGEN was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)\u201a subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)\u201a or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of NEUPOGEN therapy\u201a neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro . The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving NEUPOGEN; however\u201a the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of NEUPOGEN. Increases in lymphocyte counts following NEUPOGEN administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer. White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)\u201a including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts\u201a usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition\u201a Dohle bodies\u201a increased granulocyte granulation\u201a and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Filgrastim exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is dependent on filgrastim concentration and neutrophil count: G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance is saturated by high concentration of NEUPOGEN and is diminished by neutropenia. In addition, filgrastim is cleared by the kidney. Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL\u201a respectively\u201a within 2 to 8 hours. After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution averaged 150 mL/kg and the elimination half-life was approximately 3.5 hours in both normal subjects and cancer subjects. Clearance rates of filgrastim were approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/minute/kg. Single parenteral doses or daily intravenous doses\u201a over a 14-day period\u201a resulted in comparable half-lives. The half-lives were similar for intravenous administration (231 minutes\u201a following doses of 34.5 mcg/kg) and for subcutaneous administration (210 minutes\u201a following NEUPOGEN dosages of 3.45 mcg/kg). Continuous 24-hour intravenous infusions of 20 mcg/kg over an 11 to 20-day period produced steady-state serum concentrations of filgrastim with no evidence of drug accumulation over the time period investigated. The absolute bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60% to 70%. Specific Populations Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim is not available in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Based on limited pharmacokinetics data in irradiated non-human primates, the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), reflecting the exposure to filgrastim in non-human primates at 10 mcg/kg dose of NEUPOGEN, appears to be similar to that in humans at 5 mcg/kg. Simulations conducted using the population pharmacokinetic model indicates that the exposures to filgrastim at a NEUPOGEN dose of 10 mcg/kg in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation are expected to exceed the exposures at a dose of 10 mcg/kg in irradiated non-human primates. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adult patients receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Renal Impairment In a study with healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects with end-stage renal disease (n = 4 per group), higher serum concentrations were observed in subjects with end-stage renal disease. However, dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary. Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of filgrastim are similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n = 12/group). The study included 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Therefore, filgrastim dose adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of NEUPOGEN or of other filgrastim products. While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies using NEUPOGEN, the incidence of antibodies binding to filgrastim was 3% (11/333). In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell based bioassay. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of NEUPOGEN is unknown. Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors."

Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro . The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving NEUPOGEN; however\u201a the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of NEUPOGEN. Increases in lymphocyte counts following NEUPOGEN administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer. White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)\u201a including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts\u201a usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition\u201a Dohle bodies\u201a increased granulocyte granulation\u201a and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection."

      "12.3 Pharmacokinetics Filgrastim exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is dependent on filgrastim concentration and neutrophil count: G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance is saturated by high concentration of NEUPOGEN and is diminished by neutropenia. In addition, filgrastim is cleared by the kidney. Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL\u201a respectively\u201a within 2 to 8 hours. After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution averaged 150 mL/kg and the elimination half-life was approximately 3.5 hours in both normal subjects and cancer subjects. Clearance rates of filgrastim were approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/minute/kg. Single parenteral doses or daily intravenous doses\u201a over a 14-day period\u201a resulted in comparable half-lives. The half-lives were similar for intravenous administration (231 minutes\u201a following doses of 34.5 mcg/kg) and for subcutaneous administration (210 minutes\u201a following NEUPOGEN dosages of 3.45 mcg/kg). Continuous 24-hour intravenous infusions of 20 mcg/kg over an 11 to 20-day period produced steady-state serum concentrations of filgrastim with no evidence of drug accumulation over the time period investigated. The absolute bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60% to 70%. Specific Populations Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim is not available in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Based on limited pharmacokinetics data in irradiated non-human primates, the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), reflecting the exposure to filgrastim in non-human primates at 10 mcg/kg dose of NEUPOGEN, appears to be similar to that in humans at 5 mcg/kg. Simulations conducted using the population pharmacokinetic model indicates that the exposures to filgrastim at a NEUPOGEN dose of 10 mcg/kg in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation are expected to exceed the exposures at a dose of 10 mcg/kg in irradiated non-human primates. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adult patients receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Renal Impairment In a study with healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects with end-stage renal disease (n = 4 per group), higher serum concentrations were observed in subjects with end-stage renal disease. However, dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary. Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of filgrastim are similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n = 12/group). The study included 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Therefore, filgrastim dose adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN to decrease the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia\u201a in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs were established in a randomized\u201a double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with small cell lung cancer (Study 1). In Study 1, patients received up to 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy including intravenous cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin on day 1; and etoposide on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21 day cycles. Patients were randomized to receive NEUPOGEN (n = 99) at a dose of 230 mcg/m 2 (4 to 8 mcg/kg/day) or placebo (n = 111). Study drug was administered subcutaneously daily beginning on day 4, for a maximum of 14 days. A total of 210 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 207 were evaluable for safety. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 62 (range 31 to 80) years; 64% males; 89% Caucasian; 72% extensive disease and 28% limited disease. The main efficacy endpoint was the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 1,000/mm 3 and temperature > 38.2\u00b0C. Treatment with NEUPOGEN resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia, 40% for NEUPOGEN-treated patients and 76% for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). There were also statistically significant reductions in the incidence and overall duration of infection manifested by febrile neutropenia; the incidence, severity and duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ); the incidence and overall duration of hospital admissions; and the number of reported days of antibiotic use. 14.2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was established in a randomized, double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled\u201a multi-center trial in patients with newly diagnosed, de novo AML (Study 4). In Study 4 the initial induction therapy consisted of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous NEUPOGEN (n = 259) at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day or placebo (n = 262) from 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC \u2265 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days or \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 54 (range 16 to 89) years; 54% males; initial white blood cell count (65% < 25,000/mm 3 and 27% > 100,000/mm 3 ); 29% unfavorable cytogenetics. The main efficacy endpoint was median duration of severe neutropenia defined as neutrophil count < 500/mm 3 . Treatment with NEUPOGEN resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in median number of days of severe neutropenia, NEUPOGEN-treated patients 14 days, placebo-treated patients 19 days (p = 0.0001: difference of 5 days (95% CI: -6.0, -4.0)). There was a reduction in the median duration of intravenous antibiotic use, NEUPOGEN-treated patients: 15 days versus placebo-treated patients: 18.5 days; a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization, NEUPOGEN-treated patients: 20 days versus placebo-treated patients: 25 days. There were no statistically significant differences between the NEUPOGEN and the placebo groups in complete remission rate (69% - NEUPOGEN, 68% - placebo), median time to progression of all randomized patients (165 days - NEUPOGEN, 186 days - placebo), or median overall survival (380 days - NEUPOGEN, 425 days - placebo). 14.3 Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in 2 randomized controlled trials of patients with lymphoma (Study 6 and Study 9). The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial (Study 10). In Study 6, patients with Hodgkin's disease received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\"CVP\"), and patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\"BEAM\"). There were 54 patients randomized 1:1:1 to control, NEUPOGEN 10 mcg/kg/day, and NEUPOGEN 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour continuous infusion starting 24 hours after bone marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 57) years; 56% males; 69% Hodgkin's disease and 31% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia ANC < 500/mm 3 . A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) occurred in the NEUPOGEN-treated groups versus the control group (23 days in the control group\u201a 11 days in the 10 mcg/kg/day group, and 14 days in the 30 mcg/kg/day group [11 days in the combined treatment groups\u201a p = 0.004]). In Study 9, patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\"CVP\"). There were 43 evaluable patients randomized to continuous subcutaneous infusion NEUPOGEN 10 mcg/kg/day (n = 19), NEUPOGEN 30 mcg/kg/day (n = 10) and no treatment (n = 14) starting the day after marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 56) years; 67% males; 28% Hodgkin's disease and 72% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia. There was statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) in the NEUPOGEN-treated groups versus the control group (21.5 days in the control group versus 10 days in the NEUPOGEN-treated groups, p < 0.001). The number of days of febrile neutropenia was also reduced significantly in this study (13.5 days in the control group versus 5 days in the NEUPOGEN-treated groups\u201a p < 0.0001). In Study 10, 70 patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplantation for multiple underlying conditions using multiple preparative regimens were randomized to receive NEUPOGEN 300 mcg/m 2 /day (n = 33) or placebo (n = 37) days 5 through 28 after marrow infusion. The median age was 18 (range 1 to 45) years, 56% males. The underlying disease was: 67% hematologic malignancy, 24% aplastic anemia, 9% other. A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia occurred in the treated group versus the control group (19 days in the control group and 15 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001) and time to recovery of ANC to \u2265 500/mm 3 (21 days in the control group and 16 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001). 14.4 Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN to mobilize autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis was supported by the experience in uncontrolled trials, and a randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell rescue using NEUPOGEN-mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells to autologous bone marrow (Study 11). Patients in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: NEUPOGEN was administered for 6 to 7 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dose of NEUPOGEN ranged between 10 to 24 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Engraftment was evaluated in 64 patients who underwent transplantation using NEUPOGEN-mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells in uncontrolled trials. Two of the 64 patients (3%) did not achieve the criteria for engraftment as defined by a platelet count \u2265 20\u201a000/mm 3 by day 28. In clinical trials of NEUPOGEN for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells\u201a NEUPOGEN was administered to patients at doses between 5 to 24 mcg/kg/day after reinfusion of the collected cells until a sustainable ANC (\u2265 500/mm 3 ) was reached. The rate of engraftment of these cells in the absence of NEUPOGEN post transplantation has not been studied. Study 11 was a randomized, unblinded study of patients with Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy\u201a 27 patients received NEUPOGEN-mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells and 31 patients received autologous bone marrow. The preparative regimen was intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\"BEAM\"). Patients received daily NEUPOGEN 24 hours after stem cell infusion at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day. The median age was 33 (range 1 to 59) years; 64% males; 57% Hodgkin's disease and 43% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was number of days of platelet transfusions. Patients randomized to NEUPOGEN-mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells compared to autologous bone marrow had significantly fewer days of platelet transfusions (median 6 vs 10 days). 14.5 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The safety and efficacy of NEUPOGEN to reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of neutropenia (that is fever\u201a infections, oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic adult and pediatric patients with congenital neutropenia\u201a cyclic neutropenia\u201a or idiopathic neutropenia was established in a randomized controlled trial conducted in patients with severe neutropenia (Study 7). Patients eligible for Study 7 had a history of severe chronic neutropenia documented with an ANC < 500/mm 3 on three occasions during a 6-month period, or in patients with cyclic neutropenia 5 consecutive days of ANC < 500/mm 3 per cycle. In addition, patients must have experienced a clinically significant infection during the previous 12 months. Patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by NEUPOGEN treatment or immediate NEUPOGEN treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years); 46% males; 34% idiopathic, 17% cyclic and 49% congenital neutropenia. NEUPOGEN was administered subcutaneously. The dose of NEUPOGEN was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dose of NEUPOGEN: Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dose was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. The main efficacy endpoint was response to NEUPOGEN treatment. ANC response from baseline (< 500/mm 3 ) was defined as follows: Complete response: median ANC > 1,500/mm 3 Partial response: median ANC \u2265 500/mm 3 and \u2264 1,500/mm 3 with a minimum increase of 100% No response: median ANC < 500/mm 3 There were 112 of 123 patients who demonstrated a complete or partial response to NEUPOGEN treatment. Additional efficacy endpoints included a comparison between patients randomized to 4 months of observation and patients receiving NEUPOGEN of the following parameters: incidence of infection incidence of fever duration of fever incidence, duration, and severity of oropharyngeal ulcers number of days of antibiotic use The incidence for each of these 5 clinical parameters was lower in the NEUPOGEN arm compared to the control arm for cohorts in each of the 3 major diagnostic categories. An analysis of variance showed no significant interaction between treatment and diagnosis\u201a suggesting that efficacy did not differ substantially in the different diseases. Although NEUPOGEN substantially reduced neutropenia in all patient groups\u201a in patients with cyclic neutropenia\u201a cycling persisted but the period of neutropenia was shortened to 1 day. 14.6 Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) Efficacy studies of NEUPOGEN could not be conducted in humans with acute radiation syndrome for ethical and feasibility reasons. Approval of this indication was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals and data supporting the use of NEUPOGEN for other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration (2.1 to 2.4) ] . Because of the uncertainty associated with extrapolating animal efficacy data to humans, the selection of human dose for NEUPOGEN is aimed at providing exposures to filgrastim that exceed those observed in animal efficacy studies. The 10 mcg/kg daily dose is selected for humans exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation because the exposure associated with such a dose is expected to exceed the exposure associated with a 10 mcg/kg dose in non-human primates [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . The safety of NEUPOGEN at a daily dose of 10 mcg/kg has been assessed on the basis of clinical experience in approved indications. The efficacy of NEUPOGEN was studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in a non-human primate model of radiation injury. The planned sample size was 62 animals, but the study was stopped at the interim analysis with 46 animals because efficacy was established. Rhesus macaques were randomized to a control (n = 22) or treated (n = 24) group. Animals were exposed to total body irradiation of 7.4 \u00b1 0.15 Gy delivered at 0.8 \u00b1 0.03 Gy/min, representing a dose that would be lethal in 50% of animals by 60 days of follow-up (LD50/60). Starting on day 1 after irradiation, animals received daily subcutaneous injections of placebo (5% dextrose in water) or filgrastim (10 mcg/kg/day). Blinded treatment was stopped when one of the following criteria was met: ANC \u2265 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for more than 2 consecutive days within study day 1 to 5, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 any time after study day 5. Animals received medical management consisting of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, blood transfusions, and other support as required. Filgrastim significantly (at 0.023 level of significance) reduced 60-day mortality in the irradiated non-human primates: 21% mortality (5/24) in the filgrastim group compared to 59% mortality (13/22) in the control group."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Review the steps for direct patient administration with patients and caregivers. Training by the healthcare provider should aim to ensure that patients and caregivers can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use of NEUPOGEN vial and prefilled syringe, including showing the patient or caregiver how to measure the required dose, particularly if a patient is on a dose other than the entire prefilled syringe. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of NEUPOGEN or whether the patient would benefit from a different NEUPOGEN presentation. Advise patients of the following risks and potential risks with NEUPOGEN: Rupture or enlargement of the spleen may occur. Symptoms include left upper quadrant abdominal pain or left shoulder pain. Advise patients to report pain in these areas to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . Dyspnea, with or without fever, progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, may occur. Advise patients to report dyspnea to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] . Serious allergic reactions may occur, which may be signaled by rash\u201a facial edema\u201a wheezing\u201a dyspnea\u201a hypotension\u201a or tachycardia. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction occur [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] . In patients with sickle cell disease, sickle cell crisis and death have occurred. Discuss potential risks and benefits for patients with sickle cell disease prior to the administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] . Glomerulonephritis may occur. Symptoms include swelling of the face or ankles, dark colored urine or blood in the urine, or a decrease in urine production. Advise patients to report signs or symptoms of glomerulonephritis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] . There may be an increased risk of Myelodysplastic Syndrome and/or Acute Myeloid Leukemia in patients with congenital neutropenia who receive NEUPOGEN and in patients with breast and lung cancer who receive NEUPOGEN in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Symptoms of MDS and AML may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. Advise patients to report to their physician signs and symptoms of MDS/AML [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ]. Cutaneous vasculitis may occur, which may be signaled by purpura or erythema. Advise patients to report signs or symptoms of vasculitis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] . Aortitis may occur. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of aortitis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] . Advise patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) that efficacy studies of NEUPOGEN for this indication could not be conducted in humans for ethical and feasibility reasons and that, therefore, approval of this use was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals [see Clinical Studies (14.6) ] . Instruct patients who self-administer NEUPOGEN using the prefilled syringe or single-dose vial of the: Importance of following the applicable Instructions for Use. Dangers of reusing needles, syringes, or unused portions of single-dose vials. Importance of following local requirements for proper disposal of used syringes, needles, and unused vials. Importance of informing the healthcare provider if difficulty occurs when measuring or administering partial contents of the NEUPOGEN prefilled syringe. If difficulty occurs, use of the NEUPOGEN vial may be considered. Difference in product concentration of the NEUPOGEN prefilled syringe in comparison to the NEUPOGEN vial. When switching patients from the NEUPOGEN prefilled syringe to the NEUPOGEN vial, or vice versa, ensure that patients understand the correct volume to be administered since the concentration of NEUPOGEN differs between the prefilled syringe and the vial."

      "Patient Information NEUPOGEN \u00ae (nu-po-jen) (filgrastim) injection This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 06/2025 What is NEUPOGEN? NEUPOGEN is a man-made form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). G-CSF is a substance produced by the body. It stimulates the growth of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important in the body's fight against infection. Acute Radiation Syndrome: The effectiveness of NEUPOGEN for this use was only studied in animals, because it could not be studied in people. Do not take NEUPOGEN if you have had a serious allergic reaction to human G-CSFs such as filgrastim or pegfilgrastim products. Before you take NEUPOGEN, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: have a sickle cell disorder. have kidney problems. are receiving radiation therapy. are allergic to latex. The needle cap on the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (derived from latex). You should not give NEUPOGEN using the prefilled syringe if you have latex allergies. Ask your healthcare provider about using the vial if you have latex allergies. are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if NEUPOGEN will harm your unborn baby. are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if NEUPOGEN passes into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How will I receive NEUPOGEN? NEUPOGEN injections can be given by a healthcare provider by intravenous (IV) infusion or under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Your healthcare provider may decide subcutaneous injections can be given at home by you or your caregiver. If NEUPOGEN is given at home, see the detailed \"Instructions for Use\" that comes with your NEUPOGEN for information on how to prepare and inject a dose of NEUPOGEN. You and your caregiver should be shown how to prepare and inject NEUPOGEN before you use it, by your healthcare provider. Your healthcare provider will tell you how much NEUPOGEN to inject and when to inject it. Do not change your dose or stop NEUPOGEN unless your healthcare provider tells you to. If you are receiving NEUPOGEN because you are also receiving chemotherapy, your dose of NEUPOGEN should be injected at least 24 hours before or 24 hours after your dose of chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to monitor your white blood cell count, and if necessary, adjust your NEUPOGEN dose. If you are receiving NEUPOGEN because you have been suddenly (acutely) exposed to an amount of radiation that can affect your bone marrow (Acute Radiation Syndrome), you will need to have blood tests about every 3 days during treatment with NEUPOGEN to check your white blood cell count. If you miss a dose of NEUPOGEN, talk to your healthcare provider about when you should give your next dose. What are the possible side effects of NEUPOGEN? NEUPOGEN may cause serious side effects, including: Spleen rupture. Your spleen may become enlarged and can rupture. A ruptured spleen can cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in the left upper stomach (abdomen) area or your left shoulder. A serious lung problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if you have shortness of breath with or without a fever, trouble breathing, or a fast rate of breathing. Serious allergic reactions. NEUPOGEN can cause serious allergic reactions. These reactions can cause a rash over your whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling around your mouth or eyes, fast heart rate, and sweating. If you have any of these symptoms, stop using NEUPOGEN and call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away. Sickle cell crises. You may have a serious sickle cell crisis, which could lead to death, if you have a sickle cell disorder and receive NEUPOGEN. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of sickle cell crisis such as pain or difficulty breathing. Kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). NEUPOGEN can cause kidney injury. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: swelling of your face or ankles blood in your urine or dark colored urine you urinate less than usual Capillary leak syndrome. NEUPOGEN can cause fluid to leak from blood vessels into your body's tissues. This condition is called \"Capillary Leak Syndrome\" (CLS). CLS can quickly cause you to have symptoms that may become life-threatening. Get emergency medical help right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: swelling or puffiness and are urinating less than usual trouble breathing swelling of your stomach area (abdomen) and feeling of fullness dizziness or feeling faint a general feeling of tiredness Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) . Neupogen may increase the risk of developing a precancerous condition called MDS or a type of blood cancer called AML in people who were born with low white blood cell counts (congenital neutropenia). If you have breast cancer or lung cancer, when NEUPOGEN is used with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, or with radiation therapy only, you may have an increased risk of developing MDS or AML. Symptoms of MDS and AML may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. Call your healthcare provider if you develop any of these symptoms during treatment with NEUPOGEN. Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with NEUPOGEN. Tell your healthcare provider if you have unusual bleeding or bruising during treatment with NEUPOGEN. This could be a sign of decreased platelet counts, which may reduce the ability of your blood to clot. Increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with NEUPOGEN. Inflammation of your blood vessels (cutaneous vasculitis). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop purple spots or redness of your skin. Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis). Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported in patients who received NEUPOGEN. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, feeling tired, and back pain. Call your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms. The most common side effects experienced in patients receiving NEUPOGEN include: Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy: fever, pain, rash, cough, and shortness of breath Patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy: pain, nose bleed, and rash Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant: rash Patients who are having their own blood cells collected: bone pain, fever, and headache Patients with severe chronic neutropenia: pain, decreased red blood cells, nose bleed, diarrhea, reduced sensation, and hair loss These are not all the possible side effects of NEUPOGEN. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store NEUPOGEN? Store NEUPOGEN in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Keep NEUPOGEN in the original carton to protect from light or physical damage. Do not leave NEUPOGEN in direct sunlight. Do not shake NEUPOGEN. Take NEUPOGEN out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection.

Keep the prefilled syringe in the original carton to protect from light or physical damage. Take the prefilled syringe out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. Throw away (dispose of) any prefilled syringe that has been left at room temperature for longer than 24 hours. After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused NEUPOGEN left in the prefilled syringe. Do not save unused NEUPOGEN in the prefilled syringe for later use. Keep the NEUPOGEN prefilled syringe out of the reach of children. Using your prefilled syringe It is important that you do not try to give the injection unless you or your caregiver has received training from your healthcare provider . Make sure the name NEUPOGEN appears on the carton and prefilled syringe label. Do not use a prefilled syringe after the expiration date on the label. Do not shake the prefilled syringe. Do not remove the gray needle cap from the prefilled syringe until you are ready to inject. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the carton is open or damaged. Do not use a prefilled syringe if it has been dropped on a hard surface. The prefilled syringe may be broken even if you cannot see the break. Use a new prefilled syringe. Do not slide the orange safety guard over the needle before you give the injection. This will \"activate\" or lock the orange safety guard. Use another prefilled syringe that has not been activated and is ready to use. The gray needle cap on the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (made from latex). Tell your healthcare provider if you are allergic to latex. You should not give NEUPOGEN using the prefilled syringe if you have latex allergies. Call your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Step 1: Prepare A Remove the prefilled syringe carton from the refrigerator. Put the original carton with any unused prefilled syringes back in the refrigerator. Remove the syringe tray from the carton. On a clean, well-lit surface, place the syringe tray at room temperature for 30 minutes before you give an injection. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the carton is damaged. Do not try to warm the prefilled syringe by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. Do not leave the prefilled syringe in direct sunlight. Do not shake the prefilled syringe. Open the tray by peeling away the cover. Grab the orange safety guard to remove the prefilled syringe from the tray. For safety reasons: Do not grab the plunger rod. Do not grab the gray needle cap. B Inspect the medicine and prefilled syringe. Turn the prefilled syringe so you can see the medicine window and markings. Make sure the medicine in the prefilled syringe is clear and colorless. Do not use the prefilled syringe if: The medicine is cloudy or discolored or contains flakes or particles. Any part appears cracked or broken. The prefilled syringe has been dropped. The gray needle cap is missing or not securely attached. The expiration date printed on the label has passed. In all cases, use a new prefilled syringe and call your healthcare provider. C Gather all materials needed for your injection. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. On a clean, well-lit work surface, place the: Prefilled syringe Alcohol wipe Cotton ball or gauze pad Adhesive bandage Sharps disposal container Step 2: Get ready D Prepare and clean your injection site. You can use: Thigh Stomach area (abdomen), except for a 2 -inch area right around your navel (belly button) Upper outer area of your buttocks (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. Do not touch this area again before injecting. If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection site area you used for a previous injection. Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. E Hold the prefilled syringe by the syringe barrel. Carefully pull the gray needle cap straight off and away from your body. Do not remove the gray needle cap from the prefilled syringe until you are ready to inject. Do not twist or bend the gray needle cap. Do not hold the prefilled syringe by the plunger rod. Do not put the gray needle cap back onto the prefilled syringe. Important: Throw the gray needle cap into the sharps disposal container. F Check your prescription before you inject your dose. Your healthcare provider has prescribed either a \"full\" syringe dose or a \"partial\" syringe dose of NEUPOGEN. If you are prescribed a full dose, you will inject all of the medicine from your prefilled syringe. For a full dose, go directly to Step 3: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection. If you are prescribed a partial dose of NEUPOGEN, start with Step G below. G Point the needle up and tap gently until the air rises to the top. H Slowly push the plunger rod up to the line on the syringe barrel that matches your prescribed dose. Important: Do not slide the orange safety guard over the needle before you give the injection. This will \"activate\" or lock the orange safety guard. As you push the plunger rod up, air and extra medication is removed. Check to make sure the plunger lines up with the syringe markings for your prescribed dose. If you remove too much medicine, get a new prefilled syringe and start again at Step 1 . Call your healthcare provider if you have problems measuring your prescribed dose. Step 3: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection I Pinch your injection site to create a firm surface. Important: Keep skin pinched while injecting. J Hold the pinch. Insert the needle into the skin at 45 to 90 degrees. K Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger rod until it reaches the bottom. Do not pull back the plunger rod while the needle is inserted. When done, gently pull the syringe off of your skin. Important: When you remove the syringe, if it looks like the medicine is still in the syringe barrel, this means you have not received a full dose. Call your healthcare provider right away.

    "dosage_and_administration": [
      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy for AML o Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection, short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or continuous intravenous infusion. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation o 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy o 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.3 ) o Administer for at least 4 days before first leukapheresis procedure and continue until last leukapheresis ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Patients with congenital neutropenia o Recommended starting dose is 6 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection twice daily ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia o Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection daily ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation o 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection ( 2.5 ) \u2022 Direct administration of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) using ZARXIO prefilled syringe is not recommended due to potential for dosing errors ( 2.6 ) 2.1 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy or Induction and/or Consolidation Chemotherapy for AML The recommended starting dosage of ZARXIO is 5 mcg/kg/day\u201a administered as a single daily injection by subcutaneous injection\u201a by short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes)\u201a or by continuous intravenous infusion. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count before instituting ZARXIO therapy and monitor twice weekly during therapy. Consider dose escalation in increments of 5 mcg/kg for each chemotherapy cycle\u201a according to the duration and severity of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir. Recommend stopping ZARXIO if the ANC increases beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.10 )] . Administer ZARXIO at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Do not administer ZARXIO within the 24-hour period prior to chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.13 )] . A transient increase in neutrophil count is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of ZARXIO therapy. Therefore, to ensure a sustained therapeutic response\u201a administer ZARXIO daily for up to 2 weeks or until the ANC has reached 10\u201a000/mm 3 following the expected chemotherapy-induced neutrophil nadir. The duration of ZARXIO therapy needed to attenuate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may be dependent on the myelosuppressive potential of the chemotherapy regimen employed. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The recommended dosage of ZARXIO following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. Administer the first dose of ZARXIO at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after bone marrow infusion. Monitor CBCs and platelet counts frequently following marrow transplantation. During the period of neutrophil recovery\u201a titrate the daily dosage of ZARXIO against the neutrophil response (see Table 1). Table 1. Recommended Dosage Adjustments During Neutrophil Recovery in Patients with Cancer Following BMT Absolute Neutrophil Count ZARXIO Dosage Adjustment When ANC greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days Reduce to 5 mcg/kg/day If ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 at any time during the 5 mcg/kg/day administration\u201a increase ZARXIO to 10 mcg/kg/day\u201a and then follow the above steps. Then, if ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 more consecutive days Discontinue ZARXIO Then, if ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 Resume at 5 mcg/kg/day 2.3 Dosage in Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The recommended dosage of ZARXIO for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg/kg/day given by subcutaneous injection. Administer ZARXIO for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continue until the last leukapheresis. Although the optimal duration of ZARXIO administration and leukapheresis schedule have not been established\u201a administration of filgrastim for 6 to 7 days with leukaphereses on days 5\u201a 6\u201a and 7 was found to be safe and effective [see Clinical Studies ( 14.4 )] . Monitor neutrophil counts after 4 days of ZARXIO\u201a and discontinue ZARXIO if the white blood cell (WBC) count rises to greater than 100\u201a000/mm 3 . 2.4 Dosage in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Prior to starting ZARXIO in patients with suspected chronic neutropenia, confirm the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) by evaluating serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts\u201a and evaluating bone marrow morphology and karyotype. The use of ZARXIO prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of SCN may impair diagnostic efforts and may thus impair or delay evaluation and treatment of an underlying condition\u201a other than SCN\u201a causing the neutropenia. The recommended starting dosage in patients with Congenital Neutropenia is 6 mcg/kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection and the recommended starting dosage in patients with Idiopathic or Cyclic Neutropenia is 5 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection. Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Chronic daily administration is required to maintain clinical benefit. Individualize the dosage based on the patient\u2019s clinical course as well as ANC. In the SCN postmarketing surveillance study, the reported median daily doses of filgrastim were: 6 mcg/kg (congenital neutropenia), 2.1 mcg/kg (cyclic neutropenia), and 1.2 mcg/kg (idiopathic neutropenia). In rare instances, patients with congenital neutropenia have required doses of filgrastim greater than or equal to 100 mcg/kg/day. Monitor CBCs for Dosage Adjustments During the initial 4 weeks of ZARXIO therapy and during the 2 weeks following any dosage adjustment\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts. Once a patient is clinically stable\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts monthly during the first year of treatment. Thereafter, if the patient is clinically stable, less frequent routine monitoring is recommended. 2.5 Dosage in Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) The recommended dosage of ZARXIO is 10 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection for patients exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Administer ZARXIO as soon as possible after suspected or confirmed exposure to radiation doses greater than 2 gray (Gy). Estimate a patient\u2019s absorbed radiation dose (i.e., level of radiation exposure) based on information from public health authorities, biodosimetry if available, or clinical findings such as time to onset of vomiting or lymphocyte depletion kinetics. Obtain a baseline CBC and then serial CBCs approximately every third day until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs. Do not delay administration of ZARXIO if a CBC is not readily available. Continue administration of ZARXIO until the ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive CBCs or exceeds 10,000/mm 3 after a radiation-induced nadir. 2.6 Important Administration Instructions ZARXIO (for subcutaneous use or intravenous use) is supplied in single-dose vials and in single-dose prefilled syringes [see Dosage Forms and Strengths ( 3 )]. Administration Instructions for Subcutaneous Injection Inject ZARXIO subcutaneously in the outer area of upper arms, abdomen, thighs, or upper outer areas of the buttock. If patients or caregivers are to administer ZARXIO, instruct them in appropriate injection technique and ask them to follow the subcutaneous injection procedures in the Instructions for Use for prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive \u00ae Needle Guard or for the vial. If the patient or caregiver misses a dose of ZARXIO, instruct them to contact their healthcare provider. Patients who will self-administer and caregivers who will administer to the patient may benefit from training by a healthcare professional. Training should aim to demonstrate to those patients and caregivers how to measure the dose of ZARXIO, and the focus should be on ensuring that a patient or caregiver can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use for the vial or prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive \u00ae Needle Guard. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of ZARXIO prefilled syringe or whether the patient would benefit from the ZARXIO vial presentation. If a patient or caregiver experiences difficulty measuring the required dose, especially if it is other than the entire content of the ZARXIO prefilled syringe, use of the ZARXIO vial may be considered [see Instructions for Use] . Instructions for the Prefilled Syringe ZARXIO prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive \u00ae Needle Guard is not designed to allow for direct administration of doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg). The spring-mechanism of the needle guard apparatus affixed to the prefilled syringe interferes with the visibility of the graduation markings on the syringe barrel corresponding to 0.1 mL and 0.2 mL. The visibility of these markings is necessary to accurately measure doses of ZARXIO less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) for direct administration to patients. Thus, the direct administration to patients requiring doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. If less than 0.3 mL is needed the ZARXIO single-dose vial should be used. Persons with latex allergies should not administer the ZARXIO prefilled syringe, because the needle cap contains natural rubber latex (derived from latex). For latex sensitive individuals the ZARXIO vial should be considered as the vial stopper is not made with natural rubber latex. Prior to use\u201a remove the prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow ZARXIO to reach room temperature [between 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] for a minimum of 30 minutes. If not used immediately, the prefilled syringe may be stored at room temperature for up to 8 days. Discard any prefilled syringe left at room temperature for greater than 8 days. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (the solution is clear and colorless to slightly yellowish). Do not administer ZARXIO if particulates or discoloration are observed. Discard unused portion of ZARXIO in prefilled syringes. Do not save unused drug for later administration. Instructions for the Single-dose vial Prior to use\u201a remove the vial from the refrigerator and allow ZARXIO to reach room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes. If not used immediately, the vial may be stored at room temperature for up to 8 days. Discard any vial left at room temperature for greater than 8 days. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (the solution is clear and colorless to slightly yellowish). Do not administer ZARXIO if particulates or discoloration are observed. Discard the unused portion of ZARXIO in single-dose vial and do not re-enter the vial. Do not save unused drug for later administration. Administration Instructions for Dilution If required for intravenous administration, ZARXIO may be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP to concentrations between 5 mcg/mL and 15 mcg/mL. ZARXIO diluted to concentrations from 5 mcg/mL to 15 mcg/mL should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by the addition of Albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. When diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose plus Albumin (Human)\u201a ZARXIO is compatible with glass, polyvinylchloride, polyolefin, and polypropylene. Do not dilute with Sodium Chloride Injection at any time because the product may precipitate. Diluted ZARXIO solution from ZARXIO prefilled syringe can be stored at room temperature [between 20\u2103 to 25\u2103 (68\u2109 to 77\u2109)] for up to 24 hours. This 24\u2011hour time period includes the time during room temperature storage of the infusion solution and the duration of the infusion. Diluted ZARXIO solution from ZARXIO vial can be stored refrigerated [2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C (36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F)] for up to 24 hours or at room temperature [between 20\u2103 to 25\u2103 (68\u2109 to 77\u2109)] for up to 4 hours, including the time during room temperature storage of the infusion solution and the duration of the infusion."

( 5.2 ) \u2022 Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis : Permanently discontinue ZARXIO in patients with serious allergic reactions. ( 5.3 ) \u2022 Fatal sickle cell crises : Discontinue ZARXIO if sickle cell crisis occurs. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Glomerulonephritis : Evaluate and consider dose-reduction or interruption of ZARXIO if causality is likely. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) : Monitor patients with breast and lung cancer using ZARXIO in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Thrombocytopenia : Monitor platelet counts. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Aortitis: Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue ZARXIO if aortitis is suspected. ( 5.15 ) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, has been reported following the administration of filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue ZARXIO in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. Provide symptomatic treatment for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients receiving filgrastim products can recur within days after the discontinuation of initial anti-allergic treatment. Permanently discontinue ZARXIO in patients with serious allergic reactions. ZARXIO is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. 5.4 Sickle Cell Disorders Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur in patients with sickle cell disorders receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue ZARXIO if sickle cell crisis occurs. 5.5 Glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis has occurred in patients receiving filgrastim products. The diagnoses were based upon azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose-reduction or discontinuation of filgrastim products. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of ZARXIO. 5.6 Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization have been reported in healthy donors treated with filgrastim products undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection mobilization. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of filgrastim products. The use of ZARXIO for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication. 5.7 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) has been reported after G-CSF administration, including filgrastim products, and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.8 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating ZARXIO therapy. MDS and AML have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with filgrastim products for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of filgrastim products on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued filgrastim products administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia\u201a the risks and benefits of continuing ZARXIO should be carefully considered. Patients with Breast and Lung Cancer MDS and AML have been associated with the use of filgrastim products in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Monitor platelet counts. 5.10 Leukocytosis Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy White blood cell counts of 100\u201a000/mm 3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving filgrastim at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day. In patients with cancer receiving ZARXIO as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis\u201a it is recommended that ZARXIO therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10\u201a000/mm 3 after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of ZARXIO that increase the ANC beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a discontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days\u201a with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy During the period of administration of ZARXIO for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue ZARXIO if the leukocyte count rises to > 100,000/mm 3 . 5.11 Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim products. In most cases\u201a the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe. Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term filgrastim therapy. Hold ZARXIO therapy in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. ZARXIO may be started at a reduced dose when the symptoms resolve and the ANC has decreased. 5.12 Potential Effect on Malignant Cells ZARXIO is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G\u2011CSF) receptor through which ZARXIO acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that ZARXIO acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim products in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established. When ZARXIO is used to mobilize PBPC\u201a tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied\u201a and the limited data available are inconclusive. 5.13 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended The safety and efficacy of ZARXIO given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a do not use ZARXIO in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The safety and efficacy of ZARXIO have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of ZARXIO with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5.14 Nuclear Imaging Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results. 5.15 Aortitis Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue ZARXIO if aortitis is suspected."

Adverse reactions in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, and insomnia. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection The adverse reaction data in Table 3 are from a series of 7 trials in patients with cancer undergoing mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis. Patients (n=166) in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 8 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dosage of filgrastim ranged between 5 to 30 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous infusion. The median age was 39 (range 15 to 67) years, and 48% were male. Table 3. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous PBPC in the Mobilization Phase (\u2265 5% Incidence in Filgrastim Patients) System Organ Class Preferred Term Mobilization Phase (N=166) Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders Bone pain 30% General disorders and administration site conditions Pyrexia 16% Investigations Blood alkaline phosphatase increased 11% Nervous system disorders Headache 10% Adverse Reactions in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The following adverse reaction data were identified in a randomized, controlled study in patients with SCN receiving filgrastim (Study 7). 123 patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by subcutaneous filgrastim treatment or immediate subcutaneous filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) and 46% were male. The dosage of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dosage of filgrastim: \u2022 Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day \u2022 Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day \u2022 Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dosage was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included arthralgia, bone pain, back pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, splenomegaly, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were higher in the filgrastim arm, total infection related events were lower in filgrastim-treated patients), epistaxis, chest pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, and alopecia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of filgrastim products.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, including several observational studies of pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to filgrastim products and those who were unexposed, have not established an association with filgrastim product use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data). Reports in the scientific literature have described transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women when administered \u2264 30 hours prior to preterm delivery (\u2264 30 weeks gestation). In animal reproduction studies, effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. No maternal or fetal effects were observed in pregnant rats at doses up to 58 times the human doses. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses (see Data). The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15- 20%, respectively. Data Human Data Several observational studies based on the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) described pregnancy outcomes in women with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) who were exposed to filgrastim products during pregnancy and women with SCN who were unexposed. No major differences were seen between treated and untreated women with respect to pregnancy outcome (including miscarriage and preterm labor), newborn complications (including birth weight), and infections. Methodological limitations of these studies include small sample size and lack of generalizability due to the underlying maternal condition. Animal Data Effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses. In pregnant rabbits showing signs of maternal toxicity, reduced embryo-fetal survival (at 20 and 80 mcg/kg/day) and increased abortions (at 80 mcg/kg/day) were observed. In pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal effects were observed at doses up to 575 mcg/kg/day, which is approximately 58 times higher than the human dose of 10 mcg/kg/day. Offspring of rats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods exhibited a delay in external differentiation and growth retardation (\u2265 20 mcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is published literature documenting transfer of filgrastim into human milk. There are a few case reports describing the use of filgrastim in breastfeeding mothers with no adverse effects noted in the infants. There are no data on the effects of filgrastim products on milk production. Other filgrastim products are secreted poorly into breast milk, and filgrastim products are not absorbed orally by neonates. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother\u2019s clinical need for ZARXIO and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from ZARXIO or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use ZARXIO prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Passive \u00ae Needle Guard may not accurately measure volumes less than 0.3 mL due to the needle spring mechanism design. Therefore, the direct administration of a volume less than 0.3 mL using ZARXIO prefilled syringe is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. For direct administration of doses less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) use ZARXIO single-dose vial. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a 15 pediatric patients median age 2.6 (range 1.2 to 9.4) years with neuroblastoma were treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide\u201a cisplatin\u201a doxorubicin\u201a and etoposide) followed by subcutaneous filgrastim at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mcg/kg/day for 10 days (n=5/dose) (Study 8). The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adults receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. In this population\u201a filgrastim was well tolerated. There was one report of palpable splenomegaly and one report of hepatosplenomegaly associated with filgrastim therapy; however\u201a the only consistently reported adverse event was musculoskeletal pain\u201a which is no different from the experience in the adult population. The safety and effectiveness of ZARXIO have been established in pediatric patients with SCN [see Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . In a phase 3 study (Study 7) to assess the safety and efficacy of filgrastim in the treatment of SCN, 123 patients with a median age of 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) were studied. Of the 123 patients, 12 were infants (7 months to 2 years of age), 49 were children (2 to 12 years of age), and 9 were adolescents (12 to 16 years of age). Additional information is available from a SCN postmarketing surveillance study, which includes long-term follow-up of patients in the clinical studies and information from additional patients who entered directly into the postmarketing surveillance study. Of the 731 patients in the surveillance study, 429 were pediatric patients < 18 years of age (range 0.9 to 17) [see Indications and Usage ( 1.5 ), Dosage and Administration ( 2.6 ), and Clinical Studies ( 14.5 )] . Long-term follow-up data from the postmarketing surveillance study suggest that height and weight are not adversely affected in patients who received up to 5 years of filgrastim treatment. Limited data from patients who were followed in the phase 3 study for 1.5 years did not suggest alterations in sexual maturation or endocrine function. Pediatric patients with congenital types of neutropenia (Kostmann\u2019s syndrome, congenital agranulocytosis, or Schwachman-Diamond syndrome) have developed cytogenetic abnormalities and have undergone transformation to MDS and AML while receiving chronic filgrastim treatment. The relationship of these events to filgrastim product administration is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.8 ) and Adverse Reactions ( 6 )] . The use of ZARXIO to increase survival in pediatric patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation is based on studies of filgrastim conducted in animals and clinical data supporting the use of filgrastim in other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 to 2.4 ) and Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Among 855 subjects enrolled in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of filgrastim treated-patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there were 232 subjects age 65 or older, and 22 subjects age 75 or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Clinical studies of filgrastim in other approved indications (i.e., BMT recipients, PBPC mobilization, and SCN) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Filgrastim-sndz is a 175 amino acid human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. Filgrastim-sndz is produced by Escherichia coli ( E coli ) bacteria into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gene. Filgrastim-sndz has a molecular weight of 18\u201a800 daltons. The protein has an amino acid sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human DNA sequence analysis\u201a except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for expression in E coli . Because filgrastim-sndz is produced in E coli \u201a the product is non-glycosylated and thus differs from G-CSF isolated from a human cell. ZARXIO (filgrastim-sndz) injection is a sterile\u201a clear\u201a colorless to slightly yellowish\u201a preservative-free liquid containing filgrastim-sndz at a specific activity of 1 x 10 8 U/mg (as measured by a proliferation assay). The product is available in single-dose vials and single-dose prefilled syringes for subcutaneous or intravenous use. The single-dose vials contain either 300 mcg/mL or 480 mcg/1.6 mL of filgrastim-sndz. The single-dose prefilled syringes contain either 300 mcg/0.5 mL or 480 mcg/0.8 mL of filgrastim-sndz. The ZARXIO drug product has a pH of 4.4. See Table 4 below for product composition of each single-dose vial and prefilled syringe. Table 4.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation\u201a differentiation commitment\u201a and some end-cell functional activation. Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes\u201a fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation\u201a differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability\u201a priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst\u201a antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various nonmyeloid malignancies\u201a administration of filgrastim resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)\u201a subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)\u201a or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy\u201a neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemiluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl\u2011phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro. The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however\u201a the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer. White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)\u201a including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts\u201a usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition\u201a Dohle bodies\u201a increased granulocyte granulation\u201a and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Filgrastim products exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is dependent on filgrastim product concentration and neutrophil count: G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance is saturated by high concentration of filgrastim products and is diminished by neutropenia. In addition, filgrastim products are cleared by the kidney. Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL\u201a respectively\u201a within 2 to 8 hours. After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution averaged 150 mL/kg and the elimination half-life was approximately 3.5 hours in both normal subjects and subjects with cancer. Clearance rates of filgrastim were approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/minute/kg. Single parenteral doses or daily intravenous doses\u201a over a 14-day period\u201a resulted in comparable half-lives. The half-lives were similar for intravenous administration (231 minutes\u201a following doses of 34.5 mcg/kg) and for subcutaneous administration (210 minutes\u201a following filgrastim dosages of 3.45 mcg/kg). Continuous 24-hour intravenous infusions of 20 mcg/kg over an 11 to 20-day period produced steady-state serum concentrations of filgrastim with no evidence of drug accumulation over the time period investigated. The absolute bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60% to 70%. Specific Populations Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products are not available in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation. Based on limited pharmacokinetics data in irradiated non-human primates, the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC), reflecting the exposure to filgrastim in non-human primates at 10 mcg/kg dose of filgrastim, appears to be similar to that in humans at 5 mcg/kg. Simulations conducted using the population pharmacokinetic model indicates that the exposures to filgrastim at a filgrastim dose of 10 mcg/kg in patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation are expected to exceed the exposures at a dose of 10 mcg/kg in irradiated non-human primates. Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adult patients receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products [see Use in Specific Populations ( 8.4 )] . Renal Impairment In a study with healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects with end stage renal disease (n=4 per group), higher serum concentrations were observed in subjects with end-stage renal disease. However, dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary. Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of filgrastim are similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n=12/group). The study included 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Therefore, dose adjustment for ZARXIO in patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of filgrastim or of other filgrastim products. While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim products, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies using filgrastim, the incidence of antibodies binding to filgrastim was 3% (11/333). In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell based bioassay. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of filgrastim products is unknown. Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to decrease the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia\u201a in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs were established in a randomized\u201a double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with small cell lung cancer (Study 1). In Study 1, patients received up to 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy including intravenous cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin on day 1; and etoposide on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21 day cycles. Patients were randomized to receive filgrastim (n=99) at a dose of 230 mcg/m 2 (4 to 8 mcg/kg/day) or placebo (n=111). Study drug was administered subcutaneously daily beginning on day 4, for a maximum of 14 days. A total of 210 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 207 were evaluable for safety. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 62 (range 31 to 80) years; 64% males; 89% Caucasian; 72% extensive disease and 28% limited disease. The main efficacy endpoint was the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 1,000/mm 3 and temperature > 38.2\u00b0C. Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia, 40% for filgrastim-treated patients and 76% for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). There were also statistically significant reductions in the incidence and overall duration of infection manifested by febrile neutropenia; the incidence, severity and duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ); the incidence and overall duration of hospital admissions; and the number of reported days of antibiotic use. 14.2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was established in a randomized, double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled\u201a multi-center trial in patients with newly diagnosed, de novo AML (Study 4). In Study 4 the initial induction therapy consisted of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous filgrastim (n=259) at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day or placebo (n=262) from 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC \u22651,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days or \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 54 (range 16 to 89) years; 54% males; initial white blood cell count (65% <25,000 /mm 3 and 27% > 100,000/mm 3 ); 29% unfavorable cytogenetics. The main efficacy endpoint was median duration of severe neutropenia defined as neutrophil count < 500/mm 3 . Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in median number of days of severe neutropenia, filgrastim-treated patients 14 days, placebo-treated patients 19 days (p=0.0001: difference of 5 days (95% CI: -6.0, -4.0)). There was a reduction in the median duration of intravenous antibiotic use, filgrastim-treated patients: 15 days versus placebo-treated patients: 18.5 days; a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization, filgrastim-treated patients: 20 days versus placebo-treated patients: 25 days. There were no statistically significant differences between the filgrastim and the placebo groups in complete remission rate (69% - filgrastim, 68% - placebo), median time to progression of all randomized patients (165 days - filgrastim, 186 days - placebo), or median overall survival (380 days - filgrastim, 425 days - placebo). 14.3 Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in 2 randomized controlled trials of patients with lymphoma (Study 6 and Study 9). The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial (Study 10). In Study 6, patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\u201cCVP\u201d), and patients with non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma received intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\u201cBEAM\u201d). There were 54 patients randomized 1:1:1 to control, filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day, and filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour continuous infusion starting 24-hours after bone marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 57) years; 56% males; 69% Hodgkin\u2019s disease and 31% non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia ANC < 500/mm 3 . A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) occurred in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (23 days in the control group\u201a 11 days in the 10 mcg/kg/day group\u201a and 14 days in the 30 mcg/kg/day group [11 days in the combined treatment groups\u201a p=0.004]). In Study 9, patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\u201cCVP\u201d). There were 43 evaluable patients randomized to continuous subcutaneous infusion filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day (n=19), filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day (n=10) and no treatment (n=14) starting the day after marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 56) years; 67% males; 28% Hodgkin\u2019s disease and 72% non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia. There was statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (21.5 days in the control group versus 10 days in the filgrastim-treated groups, p < 0.001). The number of days of febrile neutropenia was also reduced significantly in this study (13.5 days in the control group versus 5 days in the filgrastim-treated groups\u201a p < 0.0001). In Study 10, 70 patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplantation for multiple underlying conditions using multiple preparative regimens were randomized to receive filgrastim 300 mcg/m 2 /day (n=33) or placebo (n=37) days 5 through 28 after marrow infusion. The median age was 18 (range 1 to 45) years, 56% males. The underlying disease was: 67% hematologic malignancy, 24% aplastic anemia, 9% other. A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia occurred in the treated group versus the control group (19 days in the control group and 15 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001) and time to recovery of ANC to \u2265 500/mm 3 (21 days in the control group and 16 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001). 14.4 Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to mobilize autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis was supported by the experience in uncontrolled trials, and a randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell rescue using filgrastim-mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells to autologous bone marrow (Study 11). Patients in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 7 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dose of filgrastim ranged between 10 to 24 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Engraftment was evaluated in 64 patients who underwent transplantation using filgrastim-mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells in uncontrolled trials. Two of the 64 patients (3%) did not achieve the criteria for engraftment as defined by a platelet count \u2265 20\u201a000/mm 3 by day 28. In clinical trials of filgrastim for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells\u201a filgrastim was administered to patients at doses between 5 to 24 mcg/kg/day after reinfusion of the collected cells until a sustainable ANC (\u2265 500/mm 3 ) was reached. The rate of engraftment of these cells in the absence of filgrastim post transplantation has not been studied. Study 11 was a randomized, unblinded study of patients with Hodgkin\u2019s disease or non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy\u201a 27 patients received filgrastim-mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells and 31 patients received autologous bone marrow. The preparative regimen was intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\u201cBEAM\u201d). Patients received daily filgrastim 24 hours after stem cell infusion at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day. The median age was 33 (range 1 to 59) years; 64% males; 57% Hodgkin\u2019s disease and 43% non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was number of days of platelet transfusions. Patients randomized to filgrastim-mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells compared to autologous bone marrow had significantly fewer days of platelet transfusions (median 6 vs 10 days). 14.5 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of neutropenia (that is fever\u201a infections, oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic adult and pediatric patients with congenital neutropenia\u201a cyclic neutropenia\u201a or idiopathic neutropenia was established in a randomized controlled trial conducted in patients with severe neutropenia (Study 7). Patients eligible for Study 7 had a history of severe chronic neutropenia documented with an ANC < 500/mm 3 on three occasions during a 6-month period, or in patients with cyclic neutropenia 5 consecutive days of ANC < 500/mm 3 per cycle. In addition, patients must have experienced a clinically significant infection during the previous 12 months. Patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by filgrastim treatment or immediate filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years); 46% males; 34% idiopathic, 17% cyclic and 49% congenital neutropenia. Filgrastim was administered subcutaneously. The dose of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dose of filgrastim: \u2022 Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day \u2022 Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day \u2022 Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dose was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. The main efficacy endpoint was response to filgrastim treatment. ANC response from baseline (< 500/mm 3 ) was defined as follows: \u2022 Complete response: median ANC > 1,500/mm 3 \u2022 Partial response: median ANC \u2265 500/mm 3 and \u2264 1,500/mm 3 with a minimum increase of 100% \u2022 No response: median ANC < 500/mm 3 There were 112 of 123 patients who demonstrated a complete or partial response to filgrastim treatment. Additional efficacy endpoints included a comparison between patients randomized to 4 months of observation and patients receiving filgrastim of the following parameters: \u2022 incidence of infection \u2022 incidence of fever \u2022 duration of fever \u2022 incidence, duration, and severity of oropharyngeal ulcers \u2022 number of days of antibiotic use The incidence for each of these 5 clinical parameters was lower in the filgrastim arm compared to the control arm for cohorts in each of the 3 major diagnostic categories. An analysis of variance showed no significant interaction between treatment and diagnosis\u201a suggesting that efficacy did not differ substantially in the different diseases. Although filgrastim substantially reduced neutropenia in all patient groups\u201a in patients with cyclic neutropenia\u201a cycling persisted but the period of neutropenia was shortened to 1 day. 14.6 Patients Acutely Exposed to Myelosuppressive Doses of Radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) Efficacy studies of filgrastim products could not be conducted in humans with acute radiation syndrome for ethical and feasibility reasons. Approval of this indication was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals and data supporting the use of filgrastim for other approved indications [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.1 to 2.4 )] . Because of the uncertainty associated with extrapolating animal efficacy data to humans, the selection of human dose for ZARXIO is aimed at providing exposures to filgrastim that exceed those observed in animal efficacy studies. The 10 mcg/kg daily dose is selected for humans exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation because the exposure associated with such a dose is expected to exceed the exposure associated with a 10 mcg/kg dose in non-human primates [see Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . The safety of filgrastim at a daily dose of 10 mcg/kg has been assessed on the basis of clinical experience in approved indications. The efficacy of filgrastim was studied in a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study in a non-human primate model of radiation injury. The planned sample size was 62 animals, but the study was stopped at the interim analysis with 46 animals because efficacy was established. Rhesus macaques were randomized to a control (n = 22) or treated (n = 24) group. Animals were exposed to total body irradiation of 7.4 \u00b1 0.15 Gy delivered at 0.8 \u00b1 0.03 Gy/min, representing a dose that would be lethal in 50% of animals by 60 days of follow-up (LD50/60). Starting on day 1 after irradiation, animals received daily subcutaneous injections of placebo (5% dextrose in water) or filgrastim (10 mcg/kg/day). Blinded treatment was stopped when one of the following criteria was met: ANC \u2265 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for more than 2 consecutive days within study day 1 to 5, or ANC \u2265 10,000/mm 3 any time after study day 5. Animals received medical management consisting of intravenous fluids, antibiotics, blood transfusions, and other support as required. Filgrastim significantly (at 0.023 level of significance) reduced 60-day mortality in the irradiated non-human primates: 21% mortality (5/24) in the filgrastim group compared to 59% mortality (13/22) in the control group."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Review the steps for direct patient administration with patients and caregivers. Training by the healthcare provider should aim to ensure that patients and caregivers can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use of ZARXIO vial and prefilled syringe, including showing the patient or caregiver how to measure the required dose, particularly if a patient is on a dose other than the entire prefilled syringe. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of ZARXIO or whether the patient would benefit from a different ZARXIO presentation. Advise patients of the following risks and potential risks with ZARXIO: \u2022 Rupture or enlargement of the spleen may occur. Symptoms include left upper quadrant abdominal pain or left shoulder pain. Advise patients to report pain in these areas to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.1 )] . \u2022 Dyspnea, with or without fever, progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, may occur. Advise patients to report dyspnea to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.2 )] . \u2022 Serious allergic reactions may occur, which may be signaled by rash\u201a facial edema\u201a wheezing\u201a dyspnea\u201a hypotension\u201a or tachycardia. Advise patients to seek immediate medical attention if signs or symptoms of hypersensitivity reaction occur [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )] . \u2022 In patients with sickle cell disease, sickle cell crisis and death have occurred. Discuss potential risks and benefits for patients with sickle cell disease prior to the administration of human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.4 )] . \u2022 Glomerulonephritis may occur. Symptoms include swelling of the face or ankles, dark colored urine or blood in the urine, or a decrease in urine production. Advise patients to report signs or symptoms of glomerulonephritis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 )] . \u2022 There may be an increased risk of Myelodysplastic Syndrome and/or Acute Myeloid Leukemia in patients with congenital neutropenia who receive filgrastim products and in patients with breast and lung cancer who receive filgrastim products in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Symptoms of MDS and AML may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. Advise patients to report to their physician signs and symptoms of MDS/AML [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)]. \u2022 Cutaneous vasculitis may occur, which may be signaled by purpura or erythema. Advise patients to report signs or symptoms of vasculitis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.11 )] . \u2022 Aortitis may occur. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers. Advise patients to report signs and symptoms of aortitis to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.15 )] . Advise patients acutely exposed to myelosuppressive doses of radiation (Hematopoietic Syndrome of Acute Radiation Syndrome) that efficacy studies of filgrastim products for this indication could not be conducted in humans for ethical and feasibility reasons and that, therefore, approval of this use was based on efficacy studies conducted in animals [see Clinical Studies ( 14.6 )]. Instruct patients who self-administer ZARXIO using the prefilled syringe or single-dose vial of the: \u2022 Importance of following the applicable Instructions for Use. \u2022 Dangers of reusing needles, syringes or unused portions of single-dose vials. \u2022 Importance of following local requirements for proper disposal of used syringes, needles, and unused vials. \u2022 Importance of informing the healthcare provider if difficulty occurs when measuring or administering partial contents of the ZARXIO prefilled syringe. If difficulties occur, use of the ZARXIO vial may be considered. \u2022 Difference in product concentration of the ZARXIO prefilled syringe in comparison to the ZARXIO vial. When switching patients from the ZARXIO prefilled syringe to the ZARXIO vial, or vice versa, ensure that patients understand the correct volume to be administered since the concentration of ZARXIO differs between the prefilled syringe and the vial.

      "Patient Information ZARXIO \u00ae (zar-zee-oh) (filgrastim-sndz) injection What is ZARXIO? ZARXIO is a man-made form of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G\u2011CSF). G-CSF is a substance produced by the body. It stimulates the growth of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell important in the body\u2019s fight against infection. Acute Radiation Syndrome: The effectiveness of filgrastim for this use was only studied in animals, because it could not be studied in people. Do not take ZARXIO if you have had a serious allergic reaction to human G-CSFs such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. Before you take ZARXIO, tell your healthcare provider about all of your medical conditions, including if you: \u2022 have a sickle cell disorder. \u2022 have kidney problems. \u2022 are receiving radiation therapy. \u2022 are allergic to latex. The needle cap on the prefilled syringe contains dry natural rubber (derived from latex). You should not give ZARXIO using the prefilled syringe if you have latex allergies. Ask your healthcare provider about using the vial if you have latex allergies. The vial stopper is not made with natural rubber latex. \u2022 are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if ZARXIO will harm your unborn baby. \u2022 are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known if ZARXIO passes into your breast milk. Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. How will I receive ZARXIO? \u2022 ZARXIO injections can be given by a healthcare provider by intravenous (IV) infusion or under your skin (subcutaneous injection). Your healthcare provider may decide subcutaneous injections can be given at home by you or your caregiver. If ZARXIO is given at home, see the detailed \u201cInstructions for Use\u201d that comes with your ZARXIO for information on how to prepare and inject a dose of ZARXIO . \u2022 You and your caregiver should be shown how to prepare and inject ZARXIO before you use it, by your healthcare provider. \u2022 Your healthcare provider will tell you how much ZARXIO to inject and when to inject it. Do not change your dose or stop ZARXIO unless your healthcare provider tells you to. \u2022 You should not inject a dose of ZARXIO less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) from a ZARXIO prefilled syringe. A dose less than 0.3 mL cannot be accurately measured using the ZARXIO prefilled syringe. \u2022 If you are receiving ZARXIO because you are also receiving chemotherapy, your dose of ZARXIO should be injected at least 24 hours before or 24 hours after your dose of chemotherapy. Your healthcare provider will do blood tests to monitor your white blood cell count, and if necessary, adjust your ZARXIO dose. \u2022 If you are receiving ZARXIO because you have been suddenly (acutely) exposed to an amount of radiation that can affect your bone marrow (Acute Radiation Syndrome), you will need to have blood tests about every 3 days during treatment with ZARXIO to check your white blood cell count. \u2022 If you miss a dose of ZARXIO, talk to your healthcare provider about when you should give your next dose. What are the possible side effects of ZARXIO? ZARXIO may cause serious side effects, including: \u2022 Spleen rupture. Your spleen may become enlarged and can rupture. A ruptured spleen can cause death. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have pain in the left upper stomach (abdomen) area or your left shoulder. \u2022 A serious lung problem called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away if you have shortness of breath with or without a fever, trouble breathing, or a fast rate of breathing. \u2022 Serious allergic reactions. ZARXIO can cause serious allergic reactions. These reactions can cause a rash over your whole body, shortness of breath, wheezing, dizziness, swelling around your mouth or eyes, fast heart rate, and sweating. If you have any of these symptoms, stop using ZARXIO and call your healthcare provider or get emergency medical help right away. \u2022 Sickle cell crises. You may have a serious sickle cell crisis, which could lead to death, if you have a sickle cell disorder and receive ZARXIO. Call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of sickle cell crisis such as pain or difficulty breathing. \u2022 Kidney injury (glomerulonephritis). ZARXIO can cause kidney injury. Call your healthcare provider right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: o swelling of your face or ankles o blood in your urine or dark colored urine o you urinate less than usual \u2022 Capillary leak syndrome. ZARXIO can cause fluid to leak from blood vessels into your body\u2019s tissues. This condition is called \u201cCapillary Leak Syndrome\u201d (CLS). CLS can quickly cause you to have symptoms that may become life-threatening. Get emergency medical help right away if you develop any of the following symptoms: o swelling or puffiness and are urinating less than usual o trouble breathing o swelling of your stomach area (abdomen) and feeling of fullness o dizziness or feeling faint o a general feeling of tiredness \u2022 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). o ZARXIO may increase the risk of developing a precancerous condition called MDS or a type of blood cancer called AML in people who were born with low white blood cell counts (congenital neutropenia). o If you have breast cancer or lung cancer, when ZARXIO is used with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, or with radiation therapy only, you may have an increased risk of developing MDS or AML. o Symptoms of MDS and AML may include tiredness, fever, and easy bruising or bleeding. o Call your healthcare provider if you develop any of these symptoms during treatment with ZARXIO. \u2022 Decreased platelet count (thrombocytopenia). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with ZARXIO. Tell your healthcare provider if you have unusual bleeding or bruising during treatment with ZARXIO. This could be a sign of decreased platelet counts, which may reduce the ability of your blood to clot. \u2022 Increased white blood cell count (leukocytosis). Your healthcare provider will check your blood during treatment with ZARXIO. \u2022 Inflammation of your blood vessels (cutaneous vasculitis). Tell your healthcare provider right away if you develop purple spots or redness of your skin. \u2022 Inflammation of the aorta (aortitis). Inflammation of the aorta (the large blood vessel which transports blood from the heart to the body) has been reported in patients who received filgrastim products. Symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, feeling tired, and back pain. Call your healthcare provider if you experience these symptoms. The most common side effects experienced in patients receiving ZARXIO include: o Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy: fever, pain, rash, cough, and shortness of breath o Patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving chemotherapy: pain, nose bleed, and rash o Patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy followed by bone marrow transplant: rash o Patients who are having their own blood cells collected: bone pain, fever, and headache o Patients with severe chronic neutropenia: pain, decreased red blood cells, nose bleed, diarrhea, reduced sensation, and hair loss These are not all the possible side effects of ZARXIO. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088. How should I store ZARXIO? \u2022 Store ZARXIO in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 Do not freeze. \u2022 Store ZARXIO in the original pack to protect it from light or physical damage.

This Patient Information has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Revised: 10/2024 Instructions for Use ZARXIO \u00ae (zar-zee-oh) (filgrastim-sndz) injection Single-Dose Prefilled Syringe Important Information You Need to Know Before Injecting ZARXIO: \u2022 Do not inject yourself or someone else until you have been shown how to inject ZARXIO. Your healthcare provider will show you how to prepare and inject ZARXIO properly using the ZARXIO prefilled syringe with UltraSafe Passive \u00ae Needle Guard. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions. \u2022 You should not inject a dose of ZARXIO less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) from a ZARXIO prefilled syringe. A dose less than 0.3 mL cannot be accurately measured using the ZARXIO prefilled syringe. \u2022 Do not use the ZARXIO prefilled syringe if either the seal on the outer pack or the seal of the blister are broken. \u2022 Keep the ZARXIO prefilled syringe in the sealed pack until you are ready to use it. \u2022 The needle cap on the prefilled syringe contains natural rubber (derived from latex). Do not handle the prefilled syringe if you are allergic to latex. \u2022 The prefilled syringe has a needle guard that will be activated to cover the needle after the injection is given. The needle guard will help prevent needle stick injuries to anyone who handles the prefilled syringe. \u2022 Avoid touching the syringe needle guard wings before use. Touching them may cause the syringe needle guard to be activated too early. \u2022 Do not remove the needle cap until just before you give the injection. \u2022 Throw away (dispose of) the used ZARXIO prefilled syringe right away after use. Do not re-use a ZARXIO prefilled syringe. See \u201c Disposing of used ZARXIO prefilled syringes \u201d at the end of this Instructions for Use. \u2022 Do not use if the syringe has been dropped onto a hard surface or dropped after removing the needle cap. Storing ZARXIO \u2022 Store ZARXIO in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 Protect from freezing ZARXIO. If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator before use. Throw away (dispose of) if it has been frozen more than 1 time. \u2022 Store ZARXIO in the original pack to protect it from light. \u2022 Avoid shaking ZARXIO. \u2022 Take ZARXIO out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) before preparing an injection. \u2022 If not used right away, ZARXIO may be kept at room temperature for up to 8 days. Throw away (dispose of) any ZARXIO that has been left at room temperature for longer than 8 days. \u2022 After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused ZARXIO left in the prefilled syringe. Do not save unused ZARXIO in the prefilled syringe for later use. Keep ZARXIO and all medicines out of the reach of children. About the ZARXIO prefilled syringe: \u2022 ZARXIO prefilled syringes come in two strengths. Depending on your prescription, you will receive ZARXIO prefilled syringes that contain 300 mcg/0.5 mL or 480 mcg/0.8 mL of medicine. Your healthcare provider will determine the microgram (mcg) dose in milliliters (mL) that you will need to give based on your body weight. When you receive your ZARXIO prefilled syringes, always check to see that the: o name ZARXIO appears on the pack and prefilled syringe label. o expiration date on the prefilled syringe label has not passed. You should not use a prefilled syringe after the date on the label. o strength of ZARXIO (number of mcg on the pack containing the prefilled syringe) is the same as what your healthcare provider prescribed. ZARXIO prefilled syringe parts (see Figure A). ZARXIO 300 mcg /0.5 mL prefilled syringe is shown as an example. Figure A What you need for your injection: Included in the pack: \u2022 A new ZARXIO prefilled syringe Not included in the pack (see Figure B): \u2022 1 Alcohol wipe \u2022 1 Cotton ball or gauze \u2022 Sharps disposal container \u2022 1 Adhesive bandage Figure B See \u201cDisposing of used ZARXIO prefilled syringes\u201d at the end of this Instructions for Use. Preparing the ZARXIO prefilled syringe Step 1. Find a clean, well-lit, flat work surface. Step 2. Take the pack containing the ZARXIO prefilled syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it unopened on your work surface for about 30 minutes so that it reaches room temperature. Step 3. Wash your hands well with soap and water. Step 4. Remove the ZARXIO prefilled syringe from the outer pack and take it out of the blister. Step 5. Check the expiration date. Do not use the ZARXIO prefilled syringe if the expiration date has passed. Step 6. Look through the viewing window on the ZARXIO prefilled syringe. The liquid inside should be clear. The color may be colorless to slightly yellow. You may see a small air bubble in the liquid. This is normal. Do not use the prefilled syringe if the liquid contains visible particles, or if the liquid is cloudy or discolored. Return the ZARXIO prefilled syringe and the package it came in to your pharmacy. Step 7. Do not use a ZARXIO prefilled syringe if it is broken. Return the broken prefilled syringe and the package it came in to your pharmacy. Step 8. Check to make sure that the plastic transparent needle guard is covering the barrel of the glass syringe. If the transparent needle guard is covering the needle cap ( see Figure C ) the needle guard has already been activated. Do not use the prefilled syringe. Get another prefilled syringe that has not been activated and is ready to use (see Figure D). Figure C shows a needle guard that has already been activated. Do not use a ZARXIO prefilled syringe that has been activated. Figure C Do Not Use Figure D shows a needle guard that has not yet been activated. The prefilled syringe is ready for use. Figure D Ready to Use Step 9: Choose the injection site: \u2022 Areas of your body that you may use as injection sites include: o the front of your thighs (see Figure E) o the lower stomach-area (abdomen), but not the area 2 inches around your navel (belly button) (see Figure E) o if a caregiver is giving you the injection \u25aa upper outer arms (see Figure E and Figure F) \u25aa upper areas of the buttocks (see Figure F) \u2022 Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. \u2022 Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. Figure E Figure F Step 10. Clean the injection site using a circular motion with the alcohol wipe. Leave it to dry before injecting. Do not touch the cleaned area again before injecting. Giving your injection Step 11. Hold the prefilled syringe by the body (the clear plastic needle guard) with the needle pointing up (see Figure G). Holding the syringe with the needle pointing up helps to prevent medicine from leaking out of the needle. Carefully pull the needle cap straight off. Throw away the needle cap. Figure G Step 12. Check the syringe for an air bubble. Gently tap the syringe body with your fingers until the air bubble rises to the top of the syringe (see Figure H). Slowly push the plunger up to push any air out of the syringe and stop when you see a small drop start to appear at the needle tip (see Figure H). Figure H \u2022 Your healthcare provider has prescribed either a \u201cfull\u201d syringe dose or a \u201cpartial\u201d syringe dose of ZARXIO. If you are prescribed a full dose, you will inject all of the medicine from your prefilled syringe. For a full dose, go directly to Step 14. \u2022 If you are prescribed a partial dose of ZARXIO, start with Step 13. Step 13. Holding the syringe as shown, press slowly on the plunger to push out the excess medicine until the edge of the conical base of the plunger stopper lines up with the syringe marking for your prescribed dose. See Figure I, example for a dose of 0.4 mL. Your dose may be different than the example shown. Be careful not to touch the needle guard wings before use. The needle guard may be activated too early. Check again to make sure the correct dose of ZARXIO is in the syringe. Call your healthcare provider if you have problems measuring or injecting your dose of ZARXIO. Figure I Step 14. With one hand gently pinch the skin at the injection site. With your other hand insert the needle into your skin as shown (see Figure J). Push the needle all the way in to make sure that you inject your full dose. Figure J Step 15. Hold the ZARXIO prefilled syringe as shown (see Figure K). Slowly press down on the plunger as far as it will go so that the plunger head is completely between the needle guard wings. Figure K Step 16. Keep the plunger fully pressed down while you carefully pull the needle straight out from the injection site (see Figure L). Figure L Step 17. Slowly release the plunger and allow the needle guard to automatically cover the exposed needle (see Figure M). Figure M Step 18. There may be a small amount of blood at the injections site. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site and hold it for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if needed. Disposing of used ZARXIO prefilled syringes Put your used prefilled syringes in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (see Figure N). Do not throw away (dispose of) ZARXIO prefilled syringes in your household trash. Figure N If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: \u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic, \u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, \u2022 upright and stable during use, \u2022 leak-resistant, and \u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles, syringes, and prefilled syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not reuse the prefilled syringe. Do not recycle the syringe, or sharps disposal container or throw them into household trash.

Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any questions. \u2022 Do not use the ZARXIO vial if either the seal on the outer pack or the cap of the vial is broken. \u2022 Keep the ZARXIO vial in the sealed pack until you are ready to use it. \u2022 Throw away (dispose of) the used ZARXIO vials, syringes, and needles right away after use. Do not re-use ZARXIO vials, syringes, or needles. See \u201c Disposing of used ZARXIO vials, syringes, and needles \u201d at the end of this Instructions for Use. \u2022 Latex-sensitive individuals: The vial stopper is not made with natural rubber latex. Storing ZARXIO \u2022 Store ZARXIO in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). \u2022 Protect ZARXIO from freezing. If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator before use. Throw away (dispose of) if it has been frozen more than 1 time. \u2022 Store ZARXIO in the original pack to protect it from light. \u2022 Avoid shaking ZARXIO. \u2022 Take ZARXIO out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature between 68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F (20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C) before preparing an injection. \u2022 If not used right away, ZARXIO may be kept at room temperature for up to 8 days. Throw away (dispose of) any ZARXIO that has been left at room temperature for longer than 8 days. \u2022 After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused ZARXIO left in the vial. Do not save unused ZARXIO in the vial for later use. Keep ZARXIO and all medicines out of the reach of children. About the ZARXIO vial: \u2022 ZARXIO vials come in two strengths. Depending on your prescription, you will receive ZARXIO vials that contain 300 mcg/mL or 480 mcg/1.6 mL of medicine. Your healthcare provider will determine the microgram (mcg) dose in milliliters (mL) that you will need to give based on your body weight. \u2022 When you receive your ZARXIO vials, always check to see that: o the name ZARXIO appears on the pack and vial label. o the expiration date on the vial label has not passed. You should not use a vial after the date on the label. o the strength of ZARXIO (number of mcg on the pack containing the vial) is the same as what your healthcare provider prescribed. What you need for your injection: Included in the pack (see Figure A): \u2022 A new ZARXIO vial Figure A Not included in the pack (see Figure B): \u2022 New disposable syringe and needle \u2022 2 Alcohol wipes \u2022 Cotton ball or gauze \u2022 Sharps disposal container \u2022 Adhesive bandage Figure B \u2022 Only use the disposable syringes and needles that your healthcare provider prescribes. \u2022 Only use the syringes and needles 1 time. Discard (throw away) any used syringes and needles. \u2022 You should only use a syringe that is marked in tenths of milliliters (mL). \u2022 Your healthcare provider will show you how to measure the correct dose of ZARXIO. This dose will be measured in milliliters (mL). See \u201cDisposing of used ZARXIO vials, syringes, and needles\u201d at the end of this Instructions for Use. Preparing the ZARXIO injection Step 1. Find a clean, well-lit, flat work surface. Step 2. Take the ZARXIO vial out of the refrigerator and leave it unopened on your work surface for about 30 minutes so that it reaches room temperature. Step 3. Wash your hands well with soap and water. Step 4. Remove the ZARXIO vial from the outer pack. Step 5. Check the expiration date. Do not use the ZARXIO vial if the expiration date has passed. Step 6. Inspect the ZARXIO vial. The liquid inside should be clear. The color may be colorless to slightly yellow. Do not use the vial if the liquid contains visible particles, or if the liquid is cloudy or discolored. Return the ZARXIO vial and the package it came into your pharmacy. Step 7. Do not use a ZARXIO vial if the cap is damaged. Return the vial with damaged cap and the package it came into your pharmacy. Step 8. Take the cap off the vial. Clean the rubber stopper with one alcohol wipe (see Figure C) . Figure C Step 9. Check the carton containing the syringe. If the carton has been opened or damaged, do not use that syringe. Dispose of (throw away) that syringe in the sharps disposal container. Step 10. Hold the syringe by the barrel with the needle cap pointing up (see Figure D). Carefully pull the needle cap straight off and away from your body. Throw away the needle cap into the sharps disposal container. Figure D Step 11. Pull back on the plunger and draw air into the syringe that is the same amount (mL) as the dose of ZARXIO that your healthcare provider prescribed. Step 12. Keep the vial on the flat working surface and insert the needle straight down through the rubber stopper. Do not insert the needle through the rubber stopper more than 1 time. Step 13. Push the plunger down and inject all the air from the syringe into the vial of ZARXIO (see Figure E) . Figure E Step 14. Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down (see Figure F) . Make sure that the ZARXIO liquid is covering the tip of the needle. Figure F Step 15. Keep the vial upside down and slowly pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe barrel with ZARXIO to the correct marking amount (mL) of medicine that matches the dose your healthcare provider prescribed. Step 16. Keep the needle in the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the syringe barrel with your finger until the air bubbles rise to the top (see Figure G) . Slowly push the plunger up to push the air bubbles out of the syringe. Figure G Step 17. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and again pull the plunger back to the number on the syringe barrel that matches your dose. Check again for air bubbles. The air in the syringe will not hurt you, but too large an air bubble can reduce your dose of ZARXIO. If there are still air bubbles, repeat the steps above to remove them. Step 18. Check again to make sure that you have the correct dose in the syringe. It is important that you use the exact dose prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not remove the needle from the vial. Lay the vial down on its side with the needle still in the vial. Step 19: Choose the injection site: \u2022 Areas of your body that you may use as injection sites include: \u25aa the front of your thighs (see Figure H) \u25aa the lower stomach-area (abdomen), but not the area 2 inches around your navel (belly button) (see Figure H) \u25aa if a caregiver is giving you the injection \u25aa upper outer arms (see Figure H and Figure I) \u25aa upper areas of the buttocks (see Figure I) \u2022 Choose a different site each time you give yourself an injection. \u2022 Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, scaly, or hard. Avoid areas with scars or stretch marks. Figure H Figure I Step 20. Clean the injection site using a circular motion with the alcohol wipe. Leave it to dry before injecting. Do not touch the cleaned area again before injecting. Giving your injection Step 21. Remove the prepared syringe and needle from the vial. Step 22. With one hand gently pinch the skin at the injection site. With your other hand insert the needle into your skin at a 45 to 90 degree angle as shown (see Figure J). Push the needle all the way in to make sure that you inject your full dose. Figure J Step 23. Hold the syringe as shown (see Figure K). Slowly press down on the plunger as far as it will go. Figure K Step 24. Keep the plunger fully pressed down while you carefully pull the needle straight out from the injection site. Step 25. There may be a small amount of blood at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site and hold it for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if needed. Disposing of used ZARXIO vials, syringes, and needles Put your used vials, syringes, and needles in an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use (see Figure L). Do not throw away (dispose of) vials, syringes, and needles in your household trash. Figure L If you do not have an FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: \u2022 made of a heavy-duty plastic, \u2022 can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, \u2022 upright and stable during use, \u2022 leak-resistant, and \u2022 properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used syringes and vials. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not reuse the vial or syringe. Do not recycle the vial, syringe, or sharps disposal container or throw them into household trash. Important: Always keep the sharps disposal container out of the reach of children. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION \u2022 Patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy or induction and/or consolidation chemotherapy for AML. o Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection, short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes), or continuous intravenous infusion. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration. ( 2.1 ) \u2022 Patients with cancer undergoing bone marrow transplantation. o 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. See Full Prescribing Information for recommended dosage adjustments and timing of administration. ( 2.2 ) \u2022 Patients undergoing autologous peripheral blood progenitor cell collection and therapy. o 10 mcg/kg/day subcutaneous injection. ( 2.3 ) o Administer for at least 4 days before first leukapheresis procedure and continue until last leukapheresis. ( 2.3 ) \u2022 Patients with congenital neutropenia. o Recommended starting dose is 6 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection twice daily. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Patients with cyclic or idiopathic neutropenia. o Recommended starting dose is 5 mcg/kg subcutaneous injection daily. ( 2.4 ) \u2022 Direct administration of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) using NIVESTYM prefilled syringe is not recommended due to potential for dosing errors. ( 2.5 ) 2.1 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy or Induction and/or Consolidation Chemotherapy for AML The recommended starting dosage of NIVESTYM is 5 mcg/kg/day\u201a administered as a single daily injection by subcutaneous injection\u201a by short intravenous infusion (15 to 30 minutes)\u201a or by continuous intravenous infusion. Obtain a complete blood count (CBC) and platelet count before instituting NIVESTYM therapy and monitor twice weekly during therapy. Consider dose escalation in increments of 5 mcg/kg for each chemotherapy cycle\u201a according to the duration and severity of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) nadir. Recommend stopping NIVESTYM if the ANC increases beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] . Administer NIVESTYM at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy. Do not administer NIVESTYM within the 24-hour period prior to chemotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.13) ] . A transient increase in neutrophil count is typically seen 1 to 2 days after initiation of NIVESTYM therapy. Therefore, to ensure a sustained therapeutic response\u201a administer NIVESTYM daily for up to 2 weeks or until the ANC has reached 10\u201a000/mm 3 following the expected chemotherapy-induced neutrophil nadir. The duration of NIVESTYM therapy needed to attenuate chemotherapy-induced neutropenia may be dependent on the myelosuppressive potential of the chemotherapy regimen employed. 2.2 Dosage in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The recommended dosage of NIVESTYM following bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is 10 mcg/kg/day given as an intravenous infusion no longer than 24 hours. Administer the first dose of NIVESTYM at least 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy and at least 24 hours after bone marrow infusion. Monitor CBCs and platelet counts frequently following marrow transplantation. During the period of neutrophil recovery\u201a titrate the daily dosage of NIVESTYM against the neutrophil response (see Table 1 ). Table 1. Recommended Dosage Adjustments During Neutrophil Recovery in Patients with Cancer Following BMT Absolute Neutrophil Count NIVESTYM Dosage Adjustment When ANC greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days Reduce to 5 mcg/kg/day If ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 at any time during the 5 mcg/kg/day administration\u201a increase NIVESTYM to 10 mcg/kg/day\u201a and then follow the above steps. Then, if ANC remains greater than 1,000/mm 3 for 3 more consecutive days Discontinue NIVESTYM Then, if ANC decreases to less than 1,000/mm 3 Resume at 5 mcg/kg/day 2.3 Dosage in Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The recommended dosage of NIVESTYM for the mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC) is 10 mcg/kg/day given by subcutaneous injection. Administer NIVESTYM for at least 4 days before the first leukapheresis procedure and continue until the last leukapheresis. Although the optimal duration of NIVESTYM administration and leukapheresis schedule have not been established\u201a administration of filgrastim for 6 to 7 days with leukaphereses on days 5\u201a 6\u201a and 7 was found to be safe and effective [see Clinical Studies (14.4) ] . Monitor neutrophil counts after 4 days of NIVESTYM\u201a and discontinue NIVESTYM if the white blood cell (WBC) count rises to greater than 100\u201a000/mm 3 . 2.4 Dosage in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Prior to starting NIVESTYM in patients with suspected chronic neutropenia, confirm the diagnosis of severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) by evaluating serial CBCs with differential and platelet counts\u201a and evaluating bone marrow morphology and karyotype. The use of NIVESTYM prior to confirmation of a correct diagnosis of SCN may impair diagnostic efforts and may thus impair or delay evaluation and treatment of an underlying condition\u201a other than SCN\u201a causing the neutropenia. The recommended starting dosage in patients with Congenital Neutropenia is 6 mcg/kg as a twice daily subcutaneous injection and the recommended starting dosage in patients with Idiopathic or Cyclic Neutropenia is 5 mcg/kg as a single daily subcutaneous injection. Dosage Adjustments in Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Chronic daily administration is required to maintain clinical benefit. Individualize the dosage based on the patient's clinical course as well as ANC. In the SCN postmarketing surveillance study, the reported median daily doses of filgrastim were: 6 mcg/kg (congenital neutropenia), 2.1 mcg/kg (cyclic neutropenia), and 1.2 mcg/kg (idiopathic neutropenia). In rare instances, patients with congenital neutropenia have required doses of filgrastim greater than or equal to 100 mcg/kg/day. Monitor CBCs for Dosage Adjustments During the initial 4 weeks of NIVESTYM therapy and during the 2 weeks following any dosage adjustment\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts. Once a patient is clinically stable\u201a monitor CBCs with differential and platelet counts monthly during the first year of treatment. Thereafter, if the patient is clinically stable, less frequent routine monitoring is recommended. 2.5 Important Administration Instructions Patient self-administration and administration by a caregiver may benefit from training by a healthcare professional. Training should aim to demonstrate to those patients and caregivers how to measure the dose using the prefilled syringe, and the focus should be on ensuring that a patient or caregiver can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use of NIVESTYM prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Plus\u2122 Passive Needle Guard. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of NIVESTYM [see Instructions for Use ] . NIVESTYM prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Plus\u2122 Passive Needle Guard is not designed to allow for direct administration of doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg). The spring-mechanism of the needle guard apparatus affixed to the prefilled syringe interferes with the visibility of the graduation markings on the syringe barrel corresponding to 0.1 mL and 0.2 mL. The visibility of these markings is necessary to accurately measure doses of NIVESTYM less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) for direct administration. Thus, the direct administration to patients requiring doses of less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. For direct administration of doses less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) use NIVESTYM single-dose vial. NIVESTYM is supplied in single-dose vials (for subcutaneous use or intravenous infusion) and single-dose prefilled syringes (for subcutaneous use) [see Dosage Forms and Strengths (3) ] . Prior to use\u201a remove the vial or prefilled syringe from the refrigerator and allow NIVESTYM to reach room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes. If not used immediately, the vial or prefilled syringe may be stored at room temperature [between 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C (68\u00b0F to 77\u00b0F)] for up to 24 hours. Discard any vial or prefilled syringe left at room temperature for greater than 24 hours. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (the solution is clear and colorless). Do not administer NIVESTYM if particulates or discoloration are observed. Discard unused portion of NIVESTYM in vials or prefilled syringes; do not re-enter the vial. Do not save unused drug for later administration. Subcutaneous Injection Inject NIVESTYM subcutaneously in the outer area of upper arms, abdomen, thighs, or upper outer areas of the buttock. If patients or caregivers are to administer NIVESTYM, instruct them in appropriate injection technique and ask them to follow the subcutaneous injection procedures in the Instructions for Use for the vial or prefilled syringe [see Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . Training by the healthcare provider should aim to demonstrate to those patients and caregivers how to measure the dose of NIVESTYM, and the focus should be on ensuring that a patient or caregiver can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use for the vial or prefilled syringe. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of NIVESTYM or whether the patient would benefit from a different NIVESTYM presentation. If a patient or caregiver experiences difficulty measuring the required dose, especially if it is other than the entire contents of the NIVESTYM prefilled syringe, use of the NIVESTYM vial may be considered. If the patient or caregiver misses a dose of NIVESTYM, instruct them to contact their healthcare provider. Administration Instructions for the Prefilled Syringe The NIVESTYM syringe plunger stopper and needle cover are not made with natural rubber latex. Administration Instructions for Dilution (Vial Only) If required for intravenous administration\u201a NIVESTYM (vial only) may be diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP from a concentration of 300 mcg/mL to 5 mcg/mL (do not dilute to a final concentration less than 5 mcg/mL). NIVESTYM diluted to concentrations from 5 mcg/mL to 15 mcg/mL should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by the addition of Albumin (Human) to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL. When diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP or 5% Dextrose plus Albumin (Human)\u201a NIVESTYM is compatible with glass bottles\u201a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polyolefin intravenous bags\u201a and polypropylene syringes. Do not dilute with saline at any time because the product may precipitate. Diluted NIVESTYM solution can be stored at room temperature for up to 24 hours. This 24-hour time period includes the time during room temperature storage of the infusion solution and the duration of the infusion."

( 5.8 ) \u2022 Thrombocytopenia: Monitor platelet counts. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Aortitis: Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving NIVESTYM. Discontinue NIVESTYM if aortitis is suspected. ( 5.15 ) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, has been reported following the administration of filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress for ARDS. Discontinue NIVESTYM in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. Provide symptomatic treatment for allergic reactions. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, in patients receiving filgrastim products can recur within days after the discontinuation of initial anti-allergic treatment. Permanently discontinue NIVESTYM in patients with serious allergic reactions. NIVESTYM is contraindicated in patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to human granulocyte colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim products or pegfilgrastim products. 5.4 Sickle Cell Disorders Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur in patients with sickle cell disorders receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue NIVESTYM if sickle cell crisis occurs. 5.5 Glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis has occurred in patients receiving filgrastim products. The diagnoses were based upon azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of filgrastim products. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose-reduction or interruption of NIVESTYM. 5.6 Alveolar Hemorrhage and Hemoptysis Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization have been reported in healthy donors treated with filgrastim products undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection mobilization. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of filgrastim products. The use of NIVESTYM for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication. 5.7 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) has been reported after G-CSF administration, including filgrastim products, and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.8 Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating NIVESTYM therapy. MDS and AML have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with filgrastim products for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of filgrastim products on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued filgrastim products administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia\u201a the risks and benefits of continuing NIVESTYM should be carefully considered. Patients with Breast and Lung Cancer MDS and AML have been associated with the use of filgrastim products in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. 5.9 Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients receiving filgrastim products. Monitor platelet counts. 5.10 Leukocytosis Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy White blood cell counts of 100\u201a000/mm 3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving filgrastim at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day. In patients with cancer receiving NIVESTYM as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis\u201a it is recommended that NIVESTYM therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10\u201a000/mm 3 after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of NIVESTYM that increase the ANC beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a discontinuation of filgrastim therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days\u201a with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy During the period of administration of NIVESTYM for PBPC mobilization in patients with cancer, discontinue NIVESTYM if the leukocyte count rises to > 100,000/mm 3 . 5.11 Cutaneous Vasculitis Cutaneous vasculitis has been reported in patients treated with filgrastim products. In most cases\u201a the severity of cutaneous vasculitis was moderate or severe. Most of the reports involved patients with SCN receiving long-term filgrastim therapy. Hold NIVESTYM therapy in patients with cutaneous vasculitis. NIVESTYM may be started at a reduced dose when the symptoms resolve and the ANC has decreased. 5.12 Potential Effect on Malignant Cells NIVESTYM is a growth factor that primarily stimulates neutrophils. The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor through which NIVESTYM acts has also been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that NIVESTYM acts as a growth factor for any tumor type cannot be excluded. The safety of filgrastim products in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia has not been established. When NIVESTYM is used to mobilize PBPC\u201a tumor cells may be released from the marrow and subsequently collected in the leukapheresis product. The effect of reinfusion of tumor cells has not been well studied\u201a and the limited data available are inconclusive. 5.13 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended The safety and efficacy of NIVESTYM given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a do not use NIVESTYM in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . The safety and efficacy of NIVESTYM have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of NIVESTYM with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5.14 Nuclear Imaging Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. This should be considered when interpreting bone-imaging results. 5.15 Aortitis Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving Filgrastim products. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c-reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue NIVESTYM if aortitis is suspected."

Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The following adverse reaction data are from one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphoblastic lymphoma receiving high-dose chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide or cytarabine, and melphalan) and total body irradiation (Study 5) and one randomized, no treatment-controlled study in patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD) and NHL undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplantation (Study 6). Patients receiving autologous bone marrow transplantation only were included in the analysis. A total of 100 patients received either 30 mcg/kg/day as a 4-hour infusion (Study 5) or 10 mcg/kg/day or 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour infusion (Study 6) filgrastim (n = 72), no treatment control or placebo (n = 28). The median age was 30 (range 15 to 57) years, 57% were male. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included rash and hypersensitivity. Adverse reactions in patients receiving intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous BMT with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included thrombocytopenia, anemia, hypertension, sepsis, bronchitis, and insomnia. Adverse Reactions in Patients with Cancer Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection The adverse reaction data in Table 3 are from a series of 7 trials in patients with cancer undergoing mobilization of autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis. Patients (n = 166) in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 8 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dosage of filgrastim ranged between 5 to 30 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous infusion. The median age was 39 (range 15 to 67) years, and 48% were male.

The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) and 46% were male. The dosage of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dosage of filgrastim: \u2022 Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day \u2022 Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day \u2022 Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dosage was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. Adverse reactions with \u2265 5% higher incidence in filgrastim patients compared to patients receiving no filgrastim included arthralgia, bone pain, back pain, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, pain in extremity, splenomegaly, anemia, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection (upper respiratory tract infection and urinary tract infection were higher in the filgrastim arm, total infection related events were lower in filgrastim-treated patients), epistaxis, chest pain, diarrhea, hypoesthesia, and alopecia. 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of filgrastim products. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. \u2022 splenic rupture and splenomegaly (enlarged spleen) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] \u2022 acute respiratory distress syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2) ] \u2022 anaphylaxis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3) ] \u2022 sickle cell disorders [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] \u2022 glomerulonephritis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] \u2022 alveolar hemorrhage and hemoptysis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6) ] \u2022 capillary leak syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7) ] \u2022 leukocytosis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] \u2022 cutaneous vasculitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.11) ] \u2022 Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis) \u2022 decreased bone density and osteoporosis in pediatric patients receiving chronic treatment with filgrastim products. \u2022 myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients with breast and lung cancer receiving chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] \u2022 aortitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.15) ] \u2022 extramedullary hematopoiesis"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Available data from published studies, including several observational studies of pregnancy outcomes in women exposed to filgrastim products and those who were unexposed, have not established an association with filgrastim products use during pregnancy and major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes (see Data ) . Reports in the scientific literature have described transplacental passage of filgrastim in pregnant women when administered \u2264 30 hours prior to preterm delivery (\u2264 30 weeks gestation). In animal reproduction studies, effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. No maternal or fetal effects were observed in pregnant rats at doses up to 58 times the human doses. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses (see Data ) . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2\u20134% and 15\u201320%, respectively. Data Human data Several observational studies based on the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) described pregnancy outcomes in women with severe chronic neutropenia (SCN) who were exposed to filgrastim products during pregnancy and women with SCN who were unexposed. No major differences were seen between treated and untreated women with respect to pregnancy outcome (including miscarriage and preterm labor), newborn complications (including birth weight) and infections. Methodological limitations of these studies, include small sample size, and lack of generalizability due to the underlying maternal condition. Animal data Effects of filgrastim on prenatal development have been studied in rats and rabbits. No malformations were observed in either species. Filgrastim has been shown to have adverse effects in pregnant rabbits at doses 2 to 10 times higher than the human doses. In pregnant rabbits showing signs of maternal toxicity, reduced embryo-fetal survival (at 20 and 80 mcg/kg/day) and increased abortions (at 80 mcg/kg/day) were observed. In pregnant rats, no maternal or fetal effects were observed at doses up to 575 mcg/kg/day, which is approximately 58 times higher than the human dose of 10 mcg/kg/day. Offspring of rats administered filgrastim during the peri-natal and lactation periods exhibited a delay in external differentiation and growth retardation (\u2265 20 mcg/kg/day) and slightly reduced survival rate (100 mcg/kg/day). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There is published literature documenting transfer of filgrastim into human milk. There are a few case reports describing the use of filgrastim in breastfeeding mothers with no adverse effects noted in the infants. There are no data on the effects of filgrastim products on milk production. Other filgrastim products are secreted poorly into breast milk, and filgrastim products are not absorbed orally by neonates. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for NIVESTYM and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from NIVESTYM or from the underlying maternal condition. 8.4 Pediatric Use NIVESTYM prefilled syringe with BD UltraSafe Plus\u2122 Passive Needle Guard may not accurately measure volumes less than 0.3 mL due to the needle spring mechanism design. Therefore, the direct administration of a volume less than 0.3 mL using NIVESTYM prefilled syringe is not recommended due to the potential for dosing errors. For direct administration of doses less than 0.3 mL (180 mcg) use NIVESTYM single-dose vial. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a 15 pediatric patients median age 2.6 (range 1.2 to 9.4) years with neuroblastoma were treated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide\u201a cisplatin\u201a doxorubicin\u201a and etoposide) followed by subcutaneous filgrastim at doses of 5, 10, or 15 mcg/kg/day for 10 days (n = 5/dose) (Study 8). The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy were similar to those in adults receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim. In this population\u201a filgrastim was well-tolerated. There was one report of palpable splenomegaly and one report of hepatosplenomegaly associated with filgrastim therapy; however\u201a the only consistently reported adverse event was musculoskeletal pain\u201a which is no different from the experience in the adult population. The safety and effectiveness of NIVESTYM have been established in pediatric patients with SCN [see Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Use of NIVESTYM for this indication is supported by NIVESTYM\u2019s approval as a biosimilar to filgrastim and evidence from a phase 3 study (Study 7) to assess the safety and efficacy of filgrastim in the treatment of SCN where 123 patients with a median age of 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years) were studied. Of the 123 patients, 12 were infants (7 months to 2 years of age), 49 were children (2 to 12 years of age), and 9 were adolescents (12 to 16 years of age). Additional information is available from a SCN postmarketing surveillance study, which includes long-term follow-up of patients in the clinical studies and information from additional patients who entered directly into the postmarketing surveillance study. Of the 731 patients in the surveillance study, 429 were pediatric patients < 18 years of age (range 0.9 to 17) [see Indications and Usage (1.5) , Dosage and Administration (2.5) , and Clinical Studies (14.5) ] . Long-term follow-up data from the postmarketing surveillance study suggest that height and weight are not adversely affected in patients who received up to 5 years of filgrastim treatment. Limited data from patients who were followed in the phase 3 study for 1.5 years did not suggest alterations in sexual maturation or endocrine function. Pediatric patients with congenital types of neutropenia (Kostmann's syndrome, congenital agranulocytosis, or Schwachman-Diamond syndrome) have developed cytogenetic abnormalities and have undergone transformation to MDS and AML while receiving chronic filgrastim treatment. The relationship of these events to filgrastim product administration is unknown [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) and Adverse Reactions (6) ] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Among 855 subjects enrolled in 3 randomized, placebo-controlled trials of filgrastim-treated patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy, there were 232 subjects age 65 or older, and 22 subjects age 75 or older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. Clinical studies of filgrastim in other approved indications (i.e., BMT recipients, PBPC mobilization, and SCN) did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and older to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects."

      "11 DESCRIPTION Filgrastim-aafi is a 175 amino acid human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. NIVESTYM is produced by Escherichia coli ( E coli) bacteria into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor gene. NIVESTYM has a molecular weight of 18\u201a799 daltons. The protein has an amino acid sequence that is identical to the natural sequence predicted from human DNA sequence analysis\u201a except for the addition of an N-terminal methionine necessary for expression in E coli . Because NIVESTYM is produced in E coli \u201a the product is non-glycosylated and thus differs from G-CSF isolated from a human cell. NIVESTYM is a sterile\u201a clear\u201a colorless\u201a preservative-free liquid containing filgrastim-aafi injection for subcutaneous or intravenous use. The product is available in single-dose vials for subcutaneous or intravenous use and prefilled syringes for subcutaneous use. The single-dose vials contain either 300 mcg/mL or 480 mcg/1.6 mL of filgrastim-aafi. The single-dose prefilled syringes contain either 300 mcg/0.5 mL or 480 mcg/0.8 mL of filgrastim-aafi. The final pH range of the NIVESTYM drug product solution is 3.8 to 4.3. See Table 4 below for product composition of each single-dose vial or prefilled syringe. Table 4.

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Colony-stimulating factors are glycoproteins which act on hematopoietic cells by binding to specific cell surface receptors and stimulating proliferation\u201a differentiation commitment\u201a and some end-cell functional activation. Endogenous G-CSF is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor that is produced by monocytes\u201a fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. G-CSF regulates the production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation\u201a differentiation, and selected end-cell functions (including enhanced phagocytic ability\u201a priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst\u201a antibody-dependent killing, and the increased expression of some cell surface antigens). G-CSF is not species-specific and has been shown to have minimal direct in vivo or in vitro effects on the production or activity of hematopoietic cell types other than the neutrophil lineage. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics In phase 1 studies involving 96 patients with various non-myeloid malignancies\u201a filgrastim administration resulted in a dose-dependent increase in circulating neutrophil counts over the dose range of 1 to 70 mcg/kg/day. This increase in neutrophil counts was observed whether filgrastim was administered intravenous (1 to 70 mcg/kg twice daily)\u201a subcutaneous (1 to 3 mcg/kg once daily)\u201a or by continuous subcutaneous infusion (3 to 11 mcg/kg/day). With discontinuation of filgrastim therapy\u201a neutrophil counts returned to baseline in most cases within 4 days. Isolated neutrophils displayed normal phagocytic (measured by zymosan-stimulated chemoluminescence) and chemotactic (measured by migration under agarose using N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine [fMLP] as the chemotaxin) activity in vitro. The absolute monocyte count was reported to increase in a dose-dependent manner in most patients receiving filgrastim; however\u201a the percentage of monocytes in the differential count remained within the normal range. Absolute counts of both eosinophils and basophils did not change and were within the normal range following administration of filgrastim. Increases in lymphocyte counts following filgrastim administration have been reported in some normal subjects and patients with cancer. White blood cell (WBC) differentials obtained during clinical trials have demonstrated a shift towards earlier granulocyte progenitor cells (left shift)\u201a including the appearance of promyelocytes and myeloblasts\u201a usually during neutrophil recovery following the chemotherapy-induced nadir. In addition\u201a Dohle bodies\u201a increased granulocyte granulation\u201a and hypersegmented neutrophils have been observed. Such changes were transient and were not associated with clinical sequelae, nor were they necessarily associated with infection. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Filgrastim products exhibit nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Clearance is dependent on filgrastim product concentration and neutrophil count: G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance is saturated by high concentration of filgrastim products and is diminished by neutropenia. In addition, filgrastim products are cleared by the kidney. Subcutaneous administration of 3.45 mcg/kg and 11.5 mcg/kg of filgrastim resulted in maximum serum concentrations of 4 and 49 ng/mL\u201a respectively\u201a within 2 to 8 hours. After intravenous administration, the volume of distribution averaged 150 mL/kg and the elimination half-life was approximately 3.5 hours in both normal subjects and cancer subjects. Clearance rates of filgrastim were approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/minute/kg. Single parenteral doses or daily intravenous doses\u201a over a 14-day period\u201a resulted in comparable half-lives. The half-lives were similar for intravenous administration (231 minutes\u201a following doses of 34.5 mcg/kg) and for subcutaneous administration (210 minutes\u201a following filgrastim dosages of 3.45 mcg/kg). Continuous 24-hour intravenous infusions of 20 mcg/kg over an 11 to 20-day period produced steady-state serum concentrations of filgrastim with no evidence of drug accumulation over the time period investigated. The absolute bioavailability of filgrastim after subcutaneous administration is 60% to 70%. Specific Populations Pediatric Patients The pharmacokinetics of filgrastim in pediatric patients after chemotherapy are similar to those in adult patients receiving the same weight-normalized doses, suggesting no age-related differences in the pharmacokinetics of filgrastim products [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) ] . Renal Impairment In a study with healthy volunteers, subjects with moderate renal impairment, and subjects with end-stage renal disease (n = 4 per group), higher serum concentrations were observed in subjects with end-stage renal disease. However, dose adjustment in patients with renal impairment is not necessary. Hepatic Impairment Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of filgrastim are similar between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy subjects (n = 12/group). The study included 10 subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A) and 2 subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B). Therefore, NIVESTYM dose adjustment for patients with hepatic impairment is not necessary. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of filgrastim or of other filgrastim products. While available data suggest that a small proportion of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim products, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. In clinical studies using filgrastim, the incidence of antibodies binding to filgrastim was 3% (11/333). In these 11 patients, no evidence of a neutralizing response was observed using a cell-based bioassay. Because of the low occurrence of anti-drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of filgrastim products is unknown. Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 Patients with Cancer Receiving Myelosuppressive Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to decrease the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia\u201a in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies receiving myelosuppressive anti-cancer drugs were established in a randomized\u201a double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with small cell lung cancer (Study 1). In Study 1, patients received up to 6 cycles of intravenous chemotherapy including intravenous cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin on day 1; and etoposide on days 1, 2, and 3 of 21 day cycles. Patients were randomized to receive filgrastim (n = 99) at a dose of 230 mcg/m 2 (4 to 8 mcg/kg/day) or placebo (n = 111). Study drug was administered subcutaneously daily beginning on day 4, for a maximum of 14 days. A total of 210 patients were evaluable for efficacy and 207 were evaluable for safety. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 62 (range 31 to 80) years; 64% males; 89% Caucasian; 72% extensive disease and 28% limited disease. The main efficacy endpoint was the incidence of febrile neutropenia. Febrile neutropenia was defined as an ANC < 1,000/mm 3 and temperature > 38.2\u00b0C. Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in the incidence of infection\u201a as manifested by febrile neutropenia, 40% for filgrastim-treated patients and 76% for placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). There were also statistically significant reductions in the incidence and overall duration of infection manifested by febrile neutropenia; the incidence, severity and duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ); the incidence and overall duration of hospital admissions; and the number of reported days of antibiotic use. 14.2 Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia Receiving Induction or Consolidation Chemotherapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the time to neutrophil recovery and the duration of fever, following induction or consolidation chemotherapy treatment of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was established in a randomized, double-blind\u201a placebo-controlled\u201a multi-center trial in patients with newly diagnosed, de novo AML (Study 4). In Study 4 the initial induction therapy consisted of intravenous daunorubicin days 1, 2, and 3; cytosine arabinoside days 1 to 7; and etoposide days 1 to 5. Patients were randomized to receive subcutaneous filgrastim (n = 259) at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day or placebo (n = 262) from 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery (ANC \u2265 1,000/mm 3 for 3 consecutive days or \u2265 10,000/mm 3 for 1 day) or for a maximum of 35 days. The demographic and disease characteristics were balanced between arms with a median age of 54 (range 16 to 89) years; 54% males; initial white blood cell count (65% < 25,000/mm 3 and 27% > 100,000/mm 3 ); 29% unfavorable cytogenetics. The main efficacy endpoint was median duration of severe neutropenia defined as neutrophil count < 500/mm 3 . Treatment with filgrastim resulted in a clinically and statistically significant reduction in median number of days of severe neutropenia, filgrastim-treated patients 14 days, placebo-treated patients 19 days (p = 0.0001: difference of 5 days (95% CI: -6.0, -4.0)). There was a reduction in the median duration of intravenous antibiotic use, filgrastim-treated patients: 15 days versus placebo-treated patients: 18.5 days; a reduction in the median duration of hospitalization, filgrastim-treated patients: 20 days versus placebo-treated patients: 25 days. There were no statistically significant differences between the filgrastim and the placebo groups in complete remission rate (69% - filgrastim, 68% - placebo), median time to progression of all randomized patients (165 days - filgrastim, 186 days - placebo), or median overall survival (380 days - filgrastim, 425 days - placebo). 14.3 Patients with Cancer Undergoing Bone Marrow Transplantation The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients with nonmyeloid malignancies undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in 2 randomized controlled trials of patients with lymphoma (Study 6 and Study 9). The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the duration of neutropenia in patients undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was evaluated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial (Study 10). In Study 6 patients with Hodgkin's disease received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\"CVP\"), and patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\"BEAM\"). There were 54 patients randomized 1:1:1 to control, filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day, and filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day as a 24-hour continuous infusion starting 24 hours after bone marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 57) years; 56% males; 69% Hodgkin's disease and 31% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia ANC < 500/mm 3 . A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) occurred in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (23 days in the control group\u201a 11 days in the 10 mcg/kg/day group, and 14 days in the 30 mcg/kg/day group [11 days in the combined treatment groups\u201a p = 0.004]). In Study 9, patients with Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma received a preparative regimen of intravenous cyclophosphamide, etoposide, and BCNU (\"CVP\"). There were 43 evaluable patients randomized to continuous subcutaneous infusion filgrastim 10 mcg/kg/day (n = 19), filgrastim 30 mcg/kg/day (n = 10) and no treatment (n = 14) starting the day after marrow infusion for a maximum of 28 days. The median age was 33 (range 17 to 56) years; 67% males; 28% Hodgkin's disease and 72% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was duration of severe neutropenia. There was statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm 3 ) in the filgrastim-treated groups versus the control group (21.5 days in the control group versus 10 days in the filgrastim-treated groups, p < 0.001). The number of days of febrile neutropenia was also reduced significantly in this study (13.5 days in the control group versus 5 days in the filgrastim-treated groups\u201a p < 0.0001). In Study 10, 70 patients scheduled to undergo bone marrow transplantation for multiple underlying conditions using multiple preparative regimens were randomized to receive filgrastim 300 mcg/m 2 /day (n = 33) or placebo (n = 37) days 5 through 28 after marrow infusion. The median age was 18 (range 1 to 45) years, 56% males. The underlying disease was: 67% hematologic malignancy, 24% aplastic anemia, 9% other. A statistically significant reduction in the median number of days of severe neutropenia occurred in the treated group versus the control group (19 days in the control group and 15 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001) and time to recovery of ANC to \u2265 500/mm 3 (21 days in the control group and 16 days in the treatment group\u201a p < 0.001). 14.4 Patients Undergoing Autologous Peripheral Blood Progenitor Cell Collection and Therapy The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to mobilize autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells for collection by leukapheresis was supported by the experience in uncontrolled trials, and a randomized trial comparing hematopoietic stem cell rescue using filgrastim mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells to autologous bone marrow (Study 11). Patients in all these trials underwent a similar mobilization/collection regimen: filgrastim was administered for 6 to 7 days\u201a in most cases the apheresis procedure occurred on days 5\u201a 6, and 7. The dose of filgrastim ranged between 10 to 24 mcg/kg/day and was administered subcutaneously by injection or continuous intravenous infusion. Engraftment was evaluated in 64 patients who underwent transplantation using filgrastim mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells in uncontrolled trials. Two of the 64 patients (3%) did not achieve the criteria for engraftment as defined by a platelet count \u2265 20\u201a000/mm 3 by day 28. In clinical trials of filgrastim for the mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor cells\u201a filgrastim was administered to patients at doses between 5 to 24 mcg/kg/day after reinfusion of the collected cells until a sustainable ANC (\u2265 500/mm 3 ) was reached. The rate of engraftment of these cells in the absence of filgrastim post transplantation has not been studied. Study 11 was a randomized, unblinded study of patients with Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoing myeloablative chemotherapy\u201a 27 patients received filgrastim-mobilized autologous hematopoietic progenitor cells and 31 patients received autologous bone marrow. The preparative regimen was intravenous BCNU, etoposide, cytosine arabinoside and melphalan (\"BEAM\"). Patients received daily filgrastim 24 hours after stem cell infusion at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day. The median age was 33 (range 1 to 59) years; 64% males; 57% Hodgkin's disease and 43% non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The main efficacy endpoint was number of days of platelet transfusions. Patients randomized to filgrastim-mobilized autologous peripheral blood progenitor cells compared to autologous bone marrow had significantly fewer days of platelet transfusions (median 6 vs 10 days). 14.5 Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia The safety and efficacy of filgrastim to reduce the incidence and duration of sequelae of neutropenia (that is fever\u201a infections, oropharyngeal ulcers) in symptomatic adult and pediatric patients with congenital neutropenia\u201a cyclic neutropenia\u201a or idiopathic neutropenia was established in a randomized controlled trial conducted in patients with severe neutropenia (Study 7). Patients eligible for Study 7 had a history of severe chronic neutropenia documented with an ANC < 500/mm 3 on three occasions during a 6-month period, or in patients with cyclic neutropenia 5 consecutive days of ANC < 500/mm 3 per cycle. In addition, patients must have experienced a clinically significant infection during the previous 12 months. Patients were randomized to a 4-month observation period followed by filgrastim treatment or immediate filgrastim treatment. The median age was 12 years (range 7 months to 76 years); 46% males; 34% idiopathic, 17% cyclic and 49% congenital neutropenia. Filgrastim was administered subcutaneously. The dose of filgrastim was determined by the category of neutropenia. Initial dose of filgrastim: \u2022 Idiopathic neutropenia: 3.6 mcg/kg/day \u2022 Cyclic neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day \u2022 Congenital neutropenia: 6 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day The dose was increased incrementally to 12 mcg/kg/day divided 2 times per day if there was no response. The main efficacy endpoint was response to filgrastim treatment. ANC response from baseline (< 500/mm 3 ) was defined as follows: \u2022 Complete response: median ANC > 1,500/mm 3 \u2022 Partial response: median ANC \u2265 500/mm 3 and \u2264 1,500/mm 3 with a minimum increase of 100% \u2022 No response: median ANC < 500/mm 3 There were 112 of 123 patients who demonstrated a complete or partial response to filgrastim treatment. Additional efficacy endpoints included a comparison between patients randomized to 4 months of observation and patients receiving filgrastim of the following parameters: \u2022 incidence of infection \u2022 incidence of fever \u2022 duration of fever \u2022 incidence, duration, and severity of oropharyngeal ulcers \u2022 number of days of antibiotic use The incidence for each of these 5 clinical parameters was lower in the filgrastim arm compared to the control arm for cohorts in each of the 3 major diagnostic categories. An analysis of variance showed no significant interaction between treatment and diagnosis\u201a suggesting that efficacy did not differ substantially in the different diseases. Although filgrastim substantially reduced neutropenia in all patient groups\u201a in patients with cyclic neutropenia\u201a cycling persisted but the period of neutropenia was shortened to 1 day."

      "17 PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION Advise the patient to read the FDA-approved patient labeling (Patient Information and Instructions for Use). Review the steps for direct patient administration with patients and caregivers. Training by the healthcare provider should aim to ensure that patients and caregivers can successfully perform all of the steps in the Instructions for Use of NIVESTYM vial and prefilled syringe, including showing the patient or caregiver how to measure the required dose, particularly if a patient is on a dose other than the entire prefilled syringe. If a patient or caregiver is not able to demonstrate that they can measure the dose and administer the product successfully, you should consider whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration of NIVESTYM or whether the patient would benefit from a different NIVESTYM presentation. Advise patients of the following risks and potential risks with NIVESTYM: \u2022 Rupture or enlargement of the spleen may occur. Symptoms include left upper quadrant abdominal pain or left shoulder pain. Advise patients to report pain in these areas to their physician immediately [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] . \u2022 Dyspnea, with or without fever, progressing to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, may occur.

Step 2: Take the carton containing the NIVESTYM prefilled syringe out of the refrigerator and leave it unopened on your work surface for at least 30 minutes so that it reaches room temperature. Put the original carton with any unused prefilled syringes back in the refrigerator. \u2022 Do not shake the prefilled syringe. \u2022 Do not leave the prefilled syringe in direct sunlight. Step 3: Wash your hands with soap and water. Step 4: Remove the prefilled syringe from the carton by the needle guard only. Do not remove the prefilled syringe by its plunger or needle cover. See Figure C . Check to make sure that the needle guard is covering the barrel of the prefilled syringe. Figure C Do not push the needle guard over the needle cover before the injection. This may activate or lock the needle guard. See Figure D that shows a needle guard that has not yet been activated. This is how the prefilled syringe looks before use. Figure D If the needle guard is covering the needle that means it has been activated. See Figure E that shows a needle guard that has been activated. This is how the prefilled syringe looks after use. Do not use the NIVESTYM prefilled syringe. Get another prefilled syringe that has not been activated and is ready to use. Figure E Step 5: Check the expiration date on the NIVESTYM prefilled syringe. Do not use the NIVESTYM prefilled syringe if the expiration date has passed. Step 6: Inspect the medicine and prefilled syringe. Turn the prefilled syringe so you can see the medicine and markings in the window. Make sure that you look at the medicine only through the viewing window on the prefilled syringe (see Figure F ). Do not inspect the medicine through the plastic of the needle guard. Make sure the medicine in the prefilled syringe is clear and colorless. Figure F \u2022 Do not use the prefilled syringe if: o The medicine is cloudy or discolored or contains flakes or particles. o Any part of the prefilled syringe appears cracked or broken. o The prefilled syringe has been dropped. o The needle cover is missing or not securely attached. o The expiration date printed on the label has passed. \u2022 In all cases, use a new prefilled syringe and call your healthcare provider. Step 7: Choose the injection site \u2022 When giving your injections, follow your healthcare provider's instructions about changing the site for each injection. \u2022 Areas of your body that you may use as injection sites include (see Figure G ): o front of your thigh o stomach area (abdomen), except for a 2-inch area around your navel (belly button) o outer area of upper arm, only if a caregiver is giving you the injection o upper outer area of your buttocks, only if a caregiver is giving you the injection Figure G o Choose a different site for each injection of NIVESTYM. o Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. Step 8: Clean your injection site with an alcohol wipe. See Figure H . \u2022 Let your skin dry. \u2022 Do not touch this area again before injecting. Figure H Step 9: Hold the prefilled syringe by the needle guard with the needle cover pointing up. Carefully pull the needle cover straight off and away from your body. Throw away the needle cover. Do not recap the needle. See Figure I . Figure I Your healthcare provider has prescribed either a \"full\" syringe dose or a \"partial\" syringe dose. \u2022 If you are prescribed a partial dose of NIVESTYM, follow Steps 10 through 18. \u2022 If you are prescribed a full dose, you will inject all of the medicine from your prefilled syringe. For a full dose, skip Steps 10 and 11, and follow Steps 12 through 18. Partial dosing Step 10: Point the needle up and tap gently until the air rises to the top. See Figure J . Figure J Step 11: Holding the prefilled syringe as shown, slowly push up on the plunger rod to push out the extra air and medicine until the end of the conical base (edge) of the plunger stopper lines up with the syringe marking for your prescribed dose. See Figure K for an example of a dose of 0.3 mL. Your dose may be different than the example shown. Be careful not to activate the needle guard before use. Do not use a NIVESTYM prefilled syringe that has been activated. See Figure E above. Check again to make sure the correct dose of NIVESTYM is in the prefilled syringe. Figure K Giving the NIVESTYM prefilled syringe injection Step 12: With one hand, gently pinch a fold of skin at the injection site. Hold the pinch. See Figure L . Figure L Step 13: With your other hand, hold the prefilled syringe like you would hold a pencil. Use a quick \"dart-like\" motion to insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle into the skin as shown. See Figure M . Figure M Step 14: Using slow and constant pressure, press down on the plunger rod until it reaches the bottom. See Figure N . Figure N Step 15: Keep the plunger rod fully pressed down while you carefully pull the needle straight out from the injection site. See Figure O . Figure O Step 16: As you let go of the plunger rod, the needle guard will automatically slide over the needle until the needle is completely covered and the needle guard locks into place. Do not recap the needle. See Figure P . Figure P Step 17: There may be a small amount of blood at the injection site. You can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site and hold it for 10 seconds. Do not rub the injection site. You may cover the injection site with a small adhesive bandage, if needed. See Figure Q . Figure Q Step 18: Throw away (dispose of) the syringe as instructed by your healthcare provider or by following the instructions below. See Figure R . Figure R Disposing of (throw away) used NIVESTYM prefilled syringes \u2022 Put the used prefilled syringe in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) prefilled syringes in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "Instructions for Use NIVESTYM (Neye-ves-tim) (filgrastim-aafi) injection Single-Dose Vial Important Read the Patient Information for important information you need to know about NIVESTYM before using these Instructions for Use. Before you use a NIVESTYM vial, read this important information: Storing your NIVESTYM vial \u2022 Store the vial in the refrigerator between 36\u02daF to 46\u02daF (2\u02daC to 8\u02daC). \u2022 Do not freeze. \u2022 Keep the vial in the original carton to protect from light or physical damage. \u2022 Take the vial out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. \u2022 Throw away (dispose of) any vial that has been left at room temperature for longer than 24 hours. \u2022 After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused NIVESTYM left in the vial. Do not save unused NIVESTYM in the vial for later use. Keep NIVESTYM and all medicines out of the reach of children. Using your vial \u2022 It is important that you do not try to give the injection unless you or your caregiver has received training from your healthcare provider. \u2022 Make sure the name NIVESTYM appears on the carton and vial label. \u2022 Only use the vial 1 time. Discard (throw away) the vial with any remaining NIVESTYM liquid. \u2022 Do not use a vial after the expiration date on the label. \u2022 Do not shake the vial. \u2022 Do not use the vial if the medicine is cloudy or discolored or contains flakes or particles. Call your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Step 1: Prepare A. Remove the vial from the refrigerator. Find a clean, well-lit, flat work surface. Place the vial on your clean work surface for 30 minutes and allow it to reach room temperature before you give an injection. \u2022 Do not try to warm the vial by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave. \u2022 Do not leave the vial in direct sunlight. \u2022 Do not shake the vial. \u2022 Use the vial only 1 time. B. Inspect the vial. Make sure the medicine in the vial is clear and colorless. \u2022 Do not use the vial if: o The medicine is cloudy or discolored or contains flakes or particles. o The expiration date printed on the label has passed. \u2022 In all cases, use a new vial and call your healthcare provider. C. Gather all materials needed for your injection. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. On your clean, well-lit, flat work surface, place: \u2022 1 Vial \u2022 1 Disposable syringe and needle \u2022 2 Alcohol wipes \u2022 1 Cotton ball or gauze pad \u2022 1 Adhesive bandage \u2022 Sharps disposal container \u2022 Only use the disposable syringes and needles that your healthcare provider prescribes. \u2022 Only use the syringes and needles 1 time. Throw away (dispose of) any used syringes and needles. See Step 5 Finish , for instructions about how to properly dispose of used syringes and needles. \u2022 You should only use a syringe that is marked in tenths of milliliters (mL). \u2022 Your healthcare provider will show you how to measure the correct dose of NIVESTYM. This dose will be measured in milliliters (mL). Step 2: Get Ready D. Take the cap off the vial. Clean the rubber stopper with 1 alcohol wipe. E. Check the carton containing the needle and syringe. If the carton has been opened or damaged, do not use that needle and syringe. Dispose of (throw away) that needle and syringe in the sharps disposal container. F. Hold the syringe by the barrel with the needle cap pointing up. Carefully pull the needle cap straight off and away from your body. Pull back on the plunger and draw air into the syringe that is the same amount (mL) as the dose of NIVESTYM that your healthcare provider prescribed. Important: Throw away the needle cap into the sharps disposal container. Do not recap the needle. G. Keep the vial on the flat work surface and insert the needle straight down through the rubber stopper. Do not insert the needle through the rubber stopper more than 1 time. H. Push the plunger down and inject all the air from the syringe into the vial of NIVESTYM. I. Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down. Make sure that the NIVESTYM liquid is covering the tip of the needle. J. Keep the vial upside down and slowly pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe barrel with NIVESTYM to the correct marking amount (mL) of medicine that matches the dose your healthcare provider prescribed. K. Keep the needle in the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the syringe barrel with your finger until the air bubbles rise to the top. Slowly push the plunger up to push the air bubbles out of the syringe. L. Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and again pull the plunger back to the number on the syringe barrel that matches your dose. Check again for air bubbles. The air in the syringe will not hurt you, but too large an air bubble can reduce your dose of NIVESTYM. If there are still air bubbles, repeat the steps above to remove them. M. Check again to make sure that you have the correct dose in the syringe. It is important that you use the exact dose prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not remove the needle from the vial. Lay the vial down on its side with the needle still in the vial. Step 3: Select and Prepare the Injection Site N. Prepare and clean your injection site. You can use: \u2022 Thigh \u2022 Stomach area (abdomen), except for a 2 -inch area right around your navel (belly button) \u2022 Upper outer area of your buttocks (only if someone else is giving you the injection) \u2022 Outer area of upper arm (only if someone else is giving you the injection) Clean your injection site with a clean alcohol wipe. Let your skin dry. \u2022 Do not touch this area again before injecting. \u2022 If you want to use the same injection site, make sure it is not the same spot on the injection site area you used for a previous injection. \u2022 Do not inject into areas where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard. Avoid injecting into areas with scars or stretch marks. Step 4: Subcutaneous (under the skin) injection O. Remove the prepared syringe and needle from the vial. P. Pinch your injection site to create a firm surface. Important: Keep skin pinched while injecting. Q. Hold the pinch. Insert the needle into the skin at a 45 to 90 degree angle. R. Using slow and constant pressure, push the plunger until it reaches the bottom. When done gently pull the needle out of the injection site at the same 45 to 90 degree angle used to insert it. Step 5: Finish S. Dispose of (throw away) the used needle and syringe. \u2022 Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles, and syringes in your household trash. \u2022 If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: o made of a heavy-duty plastic, o can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, o upright and stable during use, o leak-resistant, and o properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. \u2022 When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA's website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . \u2022 Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. T. Examine the injection site. If there is blood, press a cotton ball or gauze pad on your injection site. Do not rub the injection site. Apply an adhesive bandage if needed. This Instructions for Use has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

      "2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION Recommended dose: 5 mcg/kg per day administered as a subcutaneous injection Administer the first dose no earlier than 24 hours following myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Do not administer within 24 hours prior to chemotherapy ( 2.1 ) 2.1 Recommended Dosage The recommended dose of GRANIX is 5 mcg/kg per day administered as a subcutaneous injection. Administer the first dose of GRANIX no earlier than 24 hours following myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Do not administer GRANIX within 24 hours prior to chemotherapy. Daily dosing with GRANIX should continue until the expected neutrophil nadir is passed and the neutrophil count has recovered to the normal range. Monitor complete blood count (CBC) prior to chemotherapy and twice per week until recovery. 2.2 General Considerations for Administration GRANIX may be administered by either a healthcare professional, a patient or caregiver. Before a decision is made to allow GRANIX to be administered by a patient or caregiver, ensure that the patient is an appropriate candidate for self-administration or administration by a caregiver. Proper training on storage, preparation, and administration technique should be provided. If a patient or caregiver is not an appropriate candidate for any reason, then in such patients, GRANIX should be administered by a healthcare professional. Dispense only the prefilled syringe without a safety needle guard device to patient or caregiver. Instruct patients and caregivers to follow the Instructions for Use provided with the GRANIX prefilled syringe to properly administer an injection after training by a healthcare professional. Visually inspect parenteral drug products for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. Do not administer GRANIX if discoloration or particulates are observed. The prefilled syringe and vial are for single-dose only. Discard unused portions. GRANIX and all its components are not made with natural rubber latex. Recommended sites for subcutaneous GRANIX injections include the abdomen (except for the two-inch area around the navel), the front of the middle thighs, the upper outer areas of the buttocks, or the upper back portion of the upper arms. The injection site should be varied daily. GRANIX should not be injected into an area that is tender, red, bruised, or hard, or that has scars or stretch marks. 2.3 Important Administration Instructions for Healthcare Professionals Hold the syringe assembly by the open sides of the device and remove the needle shield. Expel any extra volume depending on dose needed. Inject GRANIX subcutaneously as recommended [ see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ]. Push the plunger as far as it will go to inject all the medication. Injection of the entire prefilled syringe contents is necessary to activate the needle guard. With the plunger still pressed all the way down, remove the needle from the skin. Slowly let go of the plunger and allow the empty syringe to move up inside the device until the entire needle is guarded. Discard the syringe assembly in approved containers. needle image 1 needle image 2 needle image 3 needle image 4 needle image 5 needleimage 6"

    "warnings_and_cautions": [
      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS Splenic Rupture: Evaluate patients who report left upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture ( 5.1 ) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS): Monitor for and manage immediately. Discontinue GRANIX if suspected ( 5.2 ) Serious Allergic Reactions Including Anaphylaxis: Permanently discontinue GRANIX in patients with serious allergic reactions ( 5.3 ) Sickle Cell Disorders: Severe and sometimes fatal crisis can occur. Discontinue GRANIX if suspected ( 5.4 ) Glomerulonephritis: Evaluate and consider dose reduction or interruption of GRANIX if causality is likely ( 5.5 ) Capillary Leak Syndrome: Monitor if symptoms develop and administer standard symptomatic treatment ( 5.6 ) Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): Monitor patients with breast and lung cancer using GRANIX in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML. ( 5.8 ) 5.1 Splenic Rupture Splenic rupture, including fatal cases, can occur following administration of filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who report upper abdominal or shoulder pain for an enlarged spleen or splenic rupture. Discontinue GRANIX if splenic rupture is suspected or confirmed. 5.2 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can occur in patients receiving filgrastim products. Evaluate patients who develop fever and lung infiltrates or respiratory distress after receiving GRANIX, for ARDS. Discontinue GRANIX in patients with ARDS. 5.3 Serious Allergic Reactions Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, can occur in patients receiving GRANIX. Reactions can occur on initial exposure. The administration of antihistamines\u201a steroids\u201a bronchodilators\u201a and/or epinephrine may reduce the severity of the reactions. Permanently discontinue GRANIX in patients with serious allergic reactions. Do not administer GRANIX to patients with a history of serious allergic reactions to filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. 5.4 Sickle Cell Disorders Severe and sometimes fatal sickle cell crises can occur in patients with sickle cell disorders receiving filgrastim products. Discontinue GRANIX if sickle cell crisis occurs. 5.5 Glomerulonephritis Glomerulonephritis can occur in patients receiving filgrastim products. The diagnoses were based on azotemia, hematuria (microscopic and macroscopic), proteinuria, and renal biopsy. Generally, events of glomerulonephritis resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of the filgrastim product. If glomerulonephritis is suspected, evaluate for cause. If causality is likely, consider dose reduction or interruption of GRANIX. 5.6 Capillary Leak Syndrome Capillary leak syndrome (CLS) can occur in patients receiving filgrastim products and is characterized by hypotension, hypoalbuminemia, edema and hemoconcentration. Episodes vary in frequency, severity and may be life-threatening if treatment is delayed. Patients who develop symptoms of capillary leak syndrome should be closely monitored and receive standard symptomatic treatment, which may include a need for intensive care. 5.7 Potential for Tumor Growth Stimulatory Effects on Malignant Cells The granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G\u2011CSF) receptor through which GRANIX acts has been found on tumor cell lines. The possibility that GRANIX acts as a growth factor for any tumor type, including myeloid malignancies and myelodysplasia, diseases for which GRANIX is not approved, cannot be excluded. 5.8 Myelodysplastic Syndrome and Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Patients with Breast and Lung Cancer Patients with Severe Chronic Neutropenia Confirm the diagnosis of SCN before initiating GRANIX therapy. MDS and AML have been reported to occur in the natural history of congenital neutropenia without cytokine therapy. Cytogenetic abnormalities, transformation to MDS, and AML have also been observed in patients treated with GRANIX for SCN. Based on available data including a postmarketing surveillance study, the risk of developing MDS and AML appears to be confined to the subset of patients with congenital neutropenia. Abnormal cytogenetics and MDS have been associated with the eventual development of myeloid leukemia. The effect of GRANIX on the development of abnormal cytogenetics and the effect of continued GRANIX administration in patients with abnormal cytogenetics or MDS are unknown. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. If a patient with SCN develops abnormal cytogenetics or myelodysplasia\u201a the risks and benefits of continuing GRANIX should be carefully considered. Patients with Breast and Lung Cancer MDS and AML have been associated with the use of GRANIX in conjunction with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy in patients with breast and lung cancer. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of MDS/AML in these settings. 5.9 Leukocytosis White blood cell counts of 100\u201a000/mm 3 or greater were observed in approximately 2% of patients receiving filgrastim products at dosages above 5 mcg/kg/day. In patients with cancer receiving GRANIX as an adjunct to myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a to avoid the potential risks of excessive leukocytosis\u201a it is recommended that GRANIX therapy be discontinued if the ANC surpasses 10\u201a000/mm 3 after the chemotherapy-induced ANC nadir has occurred. Monitor CBCs at least twice weekly during therapy. Dosages of GRANIX that increase the ANC beyond 10\u201a000/mm 3 may not result in any additional clinical benefit. In patients with cancer receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy\u201a discontinuation of filgrastim products therapy usually resulted in a 50% decrease in circulating neutrophils within 1 to 2 days\u201a with a return to pretreatment levels in 1 to 7 days. 5.10 Simultaneous Use with Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy Not Recommended The safety and efficacy of filgrastim products, including GRANIX, given simultaneously with cytotoxic chemotherapy have not been established. Because of the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid cells to cytotoxic chemotherapy\u201a do not use GRANIX in the period 24 hours before through 24 hours after the administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy [see Dosage and Administration ( 2.2 )] . The safety and efficacy of GRANIX have not been evaluated in patients receiving concurrent radiation therapy. Avoid the simultaneous use of GRANIX with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. 5.11 Nuclear Imaging Increased hematopoietic activity of the bone marrow in response to growth factor therapy has been associated with transient positive bone-imaging changes. Consider this when interpreting bone-imaging results. 5.12 Aortitis Aortitis has been reported in patients receiving another filgrastim product. It may occur as early as the first week after start of therapy. Manifestations may include generalized signs and symptoms such as fever, abdominal pain, malaise, back pain, and increased inflammatory markers (e.g., c\u2011reactive protein and white blood cell count). Consider aortitis in patients who develop these signs and symptoms without known etiology. Discontinue GRANIX if aortitis is suspected. 5.13 Alveolar Hemorrhage Alveolar hemorrhage manifesting as pulmonary infiltrates and hemoptysis requiring hospitalization has been reported in healthy donors undergoing peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC) collection treated with another filgrastim product. Hemoptysis resolved with discontinuation of filgrastim. The use of GRANIX for PBPC mobilization in healthy donors is not an approved indication."

Adverse Reactions in Adult Patients GRANIX clinical trials safety data are based upon the results of three randomized clinical trials in patients receiving myeloablative chemotherapy for breast cancer (N=348), lung cancer (N=240) and non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma (N=92). In the breast cancer study, 99% of patients were female, the median age was 50 years, and 86% of patients were Caucasian. In the lung cancer study, 80% of patients were male, the median age was 58 years, and 95% of patients were Caucasian. In the non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma study, 52% of patients were male, the median age was 55 years, and 88% of patients were Caucasian. In all three studies a placebo (Cycle 1 of the breast cancer study only) or a non-U.S.-approved filgrastim product were used as controls. Both GRANIX and the non-U.S.-approved filgrastim product were administered at 5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once daily beginning one day after chemotherapy for at least five days and continued to a maximum of 14 days or until an ANC of \u226510,000 x 10 6 /L after nadir was reached. Bone pain was the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse reaction that occurred in at least 1% or greater in patients treated with GRANIX at the recommended dose and was numerically two times more frequent than in the placebo group. The overall incidence of bone pain in Cycle 1 of treatment was 3.4% (3.4% GRANIX, 1.4% placebo, 7.5% non-U.S.-approved filgrastim product). Leukocytosis In clinical studies, leukocytosis (WBC counts > 100,000 x 10 6 /L) was observed in less than 1% patients with non-myeloid malignancies receiving GRANIX. No complications attributable to leukocytosis were reported in clinical studies. Additional Adverse Reactions Other adverse reactions known to occur following administration of filgrastim products include myalgia, headache, vomiting, cutaneous vasculitis and thrombocytopenia. Adverse Reactions in Pediatric Patients GRANIX clinical trials safety data in pediatric patients are based upon the results of one single-arm clinical trial in 50 pediatric patients who received myelosuppressive chemotherapy for treatment of solid tumors without marrow involvement [see Use in Special Populations ( 8.4 )] . In this study, GRANIX was administered at 5 mcg/kg subcutaneously once daily beginning one day after chemotherapy. The most common (>5%) adverse reactions included thrombocytopenia (34%), pyrexia (8%), pain in extremity (6%), headache (6%) and diarrhea (6%). 6.2 Postmarketing Experience The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of GRANIX. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Sweet\u2019s syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis), asthenia, diarrhea, and fatigue"

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS GRANIX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. ( 8.1 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary The limited published data on filgrastim product use during pregnancy are insufficient to inform a drug-associated risk. In animal reproduction studies, administration of tbo-filgrastim to pregnant rabbits during organogenesis resulted in increased spontaneous abortion and fetal malformations at systemic exposures 50 to 90 times the human exposure expected at the recommended human dose (see Data) . GRANIX should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Data Animal Data In an embryofetal developmental study, pregnant rabbits were administered subcutaneous doses of tbo-filgrastim during the period of organogenesis at 1, 10 and 100 mcg/kg/day. Increased abortions were evident in rabbits treated with tbo-filgrastim at 100 mcg/kg/day. This dose was maternally toxic as demonstrated by reduced body weight. Other embryofetal findings at this dose level consisted of post-implantation loss\u201a decrease in mean live litter size and fetal weight, and fetal malformations such as malformed hind limbs and cleft palate. The dose of 100 mcg/kg/day corresponds to a systemic exposure (AUC) of approximately 50 to 90 times the exposures observed in patients treated with the clinical tbo-filgrastim dose of 5 mcg/kg/day. 8.2 Lactation No data are available regarding the presence of tbo-filgrastim in human milk, the effects of the drug on the breastfed child, or the effects of the drug on milk production. Another filgrastim product was detected in human milk for up to 3 days after filgrastim administration. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child, including splenic rupture, acute respiratory distress syndrome and serious allergic reactions, advise patients not to breastfeed during treatment with GRANIX and for 2 weeks after the last dose. 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of GRANIX have been established for pediatric patients 1 month to < 17 years old (no data for the age group < 1 month old). Use of GRANIX in these age groups is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies of GRANIX in adults [see Clinical Studies (14)] with additional safety and pharmacokinetics data from a single-arm trial of 50 pediatric patients with solid tumors treated with GRANIX for chemotherapy-induced neutropenia. The 50 pediatric patients had a median age of 9.2 years (range, 1.4 to 15.9 years); 2 were infants (1 month to < 2 years old), 30 were children (2 to < 12 years old), and 18 were adolescents (12 to < 17 years old). The pharmacokinetics and safety profile of GRANIX in the pediatric population were similar to those seen in adults [see Adverse Reactions ( 6.1 ), Clinical Pharmacology ( 12.3 )] . 8.5 Geriatric Use Among 677 cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials of GRANIX, a total of 111 patients were 65 years of age and older, and 14 patients were 75 years and older. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between patients age 65 and older and younger patients."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Tbo-filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced by recombinant DNA technology. Tbo-filgrastim binds to G-CSF receptors and stimulates proliferation of neutrophils. G-CSF is known to stimulate differentiation commitment and some end-cell functional activation, which increases neutrophil counts and activity. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The time to the maximum ANC level was between 3 to 5 days and returned to baseline by 21 days following completion of chemotherapy. Doubling the tbo-filgrastim subcutaneous dose from 5 mcg/kg to 10 mcg/kg resulted in a 16% to 19% increase in the maximum ANC level and a 33% to 36% increase in the area under the effect curve for ANC. Cardiac Electrophysiology At an intravenous dose of 5 mcg/kg, tbo-filgrastim did not prolong the QT interval to any clinically relevant extent. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics Tbo-filgrastim exhibits nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Increasing the dose of subcutaneous GRANIX from 5 to 10 mcg/kg resulted in an approximate 2.5-fold increase in the maximum serum concentration (C max ) and 3.0-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC). In adult patients enrolled across three studies, subcutaneous GRANIX 5 mcg/kg resulted in median time to maximal serum tbo-filgrastim concentrations (T max ) within 4 to 6 hours. Geometric mean [coefficient of variation (CV%)] serum C max was 20 to 31 ng/mL [24% to 65%] within 4 to 6 hours. Geometric mean serum tbo-filgrastim area under the curve (AUC 0-12h ) ranged from 151 to 227 ng/mL*h [24% to 60%]. No accumulation in serum tbo-filgrastim concentrations was observed after multiple dosing. Absorption The absolute bioavailability of 5 mcg/kg subcutaneous tbo-filgrastim was 33%. Metabolism/Elimination Tbo-filgrastim clearance is primarily dependent on G-CSF receptor-mediated clearance which can be saturated by high serum concentrations of tbo-filgrastim and diminished in neutropenia. The median serum elimination half-life of tbo-filgrastim (5 mcg/kg sc) was 3.0 to 3.5 hours. Specific Populations No sex-related differences were observed. Pediatric Patients: The geometric mean [coefficient of variation (CV%)] of C max was 18 ng/mL (56%) and AUC 0-12h was 130 ng*hr/mL (52%) following subcutaneous administration of GRANIX 5 mcg/kg in 49 pediatric patients (1.4 to 15.9 years) after chemotherapy. No clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of GRANIX were observed between infants, children and adolescents. Patients with Renal or Hepatic Impairment: Mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance 60 to 89 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault) had no effect on tbo-filgrastim pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetics in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment has not been studied. The pharmacokinetics in patients with hepatic impairment has not been studied. 12.6 Immunogenicity The observed incidence of anti-drug antibodies is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Differences in assay methods preclude meaningful comparisons of the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in the studies described below with the incidence of anti-drug antibodies in other studies, including those of GRANIX or of other filgrastim products. While available data suggest that 1.4% of patients developed binding antibodies to filgrastim, the nature and specificity of these antibodies has not been adequately studied. Because of the low occurrence of anti- drug antibodies, the effect of these antibodies on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, and/or effectiveness of GRANIX is unknown. Cytopenias resulting from an antibody response to exogenous growth factors have been reported on rare occasions in patients treated with other recombinant growth factors."

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE - Prefilled Syringe GRANIX (GRAN-icks) (tbo-filgrastim) for subcutaneous injection Single-Dose Prefilled Syringe Important: Read the Prescribing information and Patient Package insert for important information about GRANIX. About the GRANIX syringe Depending on the prescription that your healthcare provider gave you, you will receive a syringe that provides a dose of either 0.1 mL to 0.5 mL or 0.1 mL to 0.8 mL. If you are prescribed a dose over 0.8 mL, two syringes will be required to reach your prescribed dose. Your healthcare provider will determine how many syringes and the correct dose in milliliters (mL) you will need to give based on your body weight. You should continue to give GRANIX daily until your healthcare provider informs you that your white blood cell count has returned to normal. Make sure you understand the following: How to store your syringes. How to read the syringe markings. How to adjust the amount of GRANIX in the syringe for your prescribed dose. How to prepare and give the injection. Do not shake syringes. Do not remove the needle cap until you are ready to inject. Do not re-use a syringe. The syringe is for single-use only. Your first dose of GRANIX is given at least 24 hours after you receive your chemotherapy. Do not inject GRANIX within 24 hours before your next dose of chemotherapy. Dosing schedule Inject your total daily dose 1 time each day as prescribed by your healthcare provider, starting at least 24 hours (1 day) after the end of your chemotherapy cycle. You should continue to give GRANIX daily until your white blood cell count returns to normal. How to store your GRANIX syringes Store GRANIX in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Store GRANIX in the original carton to protect it from light. Do not shake. Take GRANIX out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. GRANIX syringes can be left at room temperature for a single period of up to 5 days, and if not used can be returned to the refrigerator. Throw away (dispose of) any GRANIX syringes that have been left at room temperature for more than 5 days. After you inject your dose, throw away (dispose of) any unused GRANIX left in the syringe. Do not save unused GRANIX in the syringe for later use. Keep GRANIX and all medicines out of the reach of children. Determining how many syringes you need for your daily dose If your prescribed daily dose is 0.5 mL or less, use 1 syringe. If your prescribed daily dose is 0.8 mL or less, use 1 syringe. If your prescribed daily dose is more than 0.8 mL you will need to prepare 2 syringes in order to match your prescribed dose: Adjust your first syringe to 0.8 mL. Adjust your second syringe to the additional amount required to make up your total prescribed dose. Make sure the amounts in both syringes add up to your prescribed dose (See the table to the right to determine how much medicine should be in each syringe). For example: If your prescribed dose is 1 mL you would prepare 1 syringe with 0.8 mL and a second syringe with 0.2 mL. Important : When using 2 syringes always adjust the first syringe to 0.8 mL. How to read the syringe markings What the markings on the syringe mean: The syringe is labeled in 0.1 mL unit increments from 0.1 mL to 0.8 mL. There is a line next to each 0.1 mL unit increment. To read the dose scale always hold the syringe with the needle-end facing up so that 0.1 mL is at the top and 0.8 mL is at the bottom. How to adjust the medicine level for your prescribed dose When setting your dose, ( See 2C ) you will line up the top edge of the grey rubber stopper with the line on the syringe scale that matches your prescribed dose. Note : The top edge of the grey rubber stopper is the edge directly below the dome at the top of the stopper. Do not use the top of the cone or the middle or lower edges of the grey stopper to measure your dose. Injection steps (follow the steps below for each day of dosing) 1. Prepare for injection 1A Each time you inject a dose gather the following supplies: GRANIX syringe(s) Alcohol swabs Paper towel Cotton ball or gauze pad Adhesive Bandage, if needed Sharps disposal container (hard-walled container for discarding syringes) Note: GRANIX and all of the parts of the prefilled syringe do not contain natural rubber latex. 1B Take the carton with the syringe(s) out of the refrigerator 1C Check the label and the expiration date on the side of the carton Important: Do not inject if: \u201cGRANIX \u00ae (tbo-filgrastim)\u201d is not listed on the carton. The expiration date on the syringe label has passed. 1D Remove the syringe(s) from the carton Open the carton by breaking the tamper proof seal and lifting the lid. Remove the number of syringes required for your daily dose by grasping each at the middle of the syringe body. After removing your required number of syringes, place the carton back in the refrigerator. 1E Look carefully at the syringe(s) and the medicine Hold the syringe body and check to make sure it is not damaged. Inspect the medicine in the syringe. GRANIX should be a clear liquid. Important: Do not inject if: GRANIX \u00ae (tbo-filgrastim) is not listed on the syringe label. The medicine is cloudy, discolored, or foamy. The medicine contains lumps, flakes, or particles. 1F Wait 30 minutes for the syringe(s) to warm to room temperature Wait 30 minutes for GRANIX to naturally warm to room temperature. This will provide a more comfortable injection. 1G Wash your hands When ready to inject, wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry thoroughly with a clean towel. 1H Choose an injection site The recommended injection sites are: If you are self-injecting: Stomach-area (abdomen): Except for a 2-inch area around the navel (belly button). Thighs: Top or middle area of thighs. If a caregiver is injecting GRANIX for you: Arms: Fleshy areas on upper, back part of the arm. Upper hip or buttock: Fleshy areas around the back of the upper hips and upper sides of the buttocks. If 2 injections will be performed, then the second injection should be at least 1 inch away from the first injection. Choose Injection Site Do not inject into areas that are tender, red, bruised, hard, or have scars or stretch marks. Important: You should select a different injection site each time you give yourself an injection. If you want to use the same injection site for a dose requiring 2 injections, make sure the second injection site is at least 1 inch away from the first injection site. 1I Clean the injection site using an alcohol swab Allow site to dry for 5-10 seconds to avoid stinging. If giving 2 injections, then the distance between the 2 injection sites should be at least 1 inch apart. Do not touch or blow on site after cleaning. 2. Adjust medicine level for your prescribed dose 2A Remove the needle cap from the syringe Place a paper towel on the table. To remove the needle cap, hold the body of the syringe firmly with 1 hand (with the needle facing away from you). Pull the needle cap straight off, extending your hand away from the needle. Note: Throw away the needle cap in a sharps disposal container. Do not recap the needle now or after the injection. 2B Hold the syringe upright and tap Hold the syringe upright (needle pointing up), as shown. Gently tap the barrel with your fingers to make sure any air bubbles rise to the top. 2C Slowly and carefully adjust the medicine level Hold the syringe with the needle pointing up and slightly away from you , as shown. Make sure you can easily see the syringe markings and numbers. Holding the plunger as shown, very slowly and carefully push the plunger up until the top edge of the grey rubber stopper is even with the line that corresponds to your prescribed dose. Note: If GRANIX gets on your skin, wash your skin with soap and water. If GRANIX get in your eyes, flush well with water. Note: If you accidentally removed too much GRANIX, contact your healthcare provider before giving your injection. 3. INJECT MEDICATION 3A Pinch skin The illustration below is an example only Use your free hand to firmly pinch the skin you previously cleaned. 3B Insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle Hold the body of the syringe between your thumb and index finger. Use a quick motion to fully insert the needle straight into the pinched skin at a 45 to 90 degree angle. When the needle is inserted, you can release the pinched skin. Do not hold or push on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin. 3C Push the plunger down to inject all of the GRANIX Use your finger to gently push down on the plunger. When the plunger head is as far down as it will go, all of the GRANIX has been injected. When done, gently remove the needle from the skin. 3D Throw away (dispose of) used syringe Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal. Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. 3E Treat the injection site if needed and wash your hands If you see drops of blood at the injection site, you can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site for several seconds to stop the bleeding. Apply bandage, if needed. When you are finished, wash your hands with soap and warm water and dry thoroughly with a clean towel. 4. Repeat the injection steps with the second syringe (If dose is more than 0.8 mL) If your dose is more than 0.8 mL: Follow instructions 3A through 3E for injecting. Choose a different site for your second injection. If you want to use the same part of your body, make sure the second injection site is at least 1 inch away from the first injection site. If you have any questions or concerns about your dose of GRANIX or how to prepare and give your injections, call your healthcare provider.

      "INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE - VIAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE GRANIX (GRAN-icks) (tbo-filgrastim) for subcutaneous injection Single-Dose Vial Important: Read the Prescribing information and Patient Package insert for important information about GRANIX. Before you use a GRANIX vial, read this important information: GRANIX vial is supplied as either 300 mcg in 1 mL solution, or 480 mcg of tbo-filgrastim in 1.6 mL solution. Your healthcare provider will determine which strength of GRANIX to prescribe for you. Your healthcare provider will prescribe the correct number of vials, and the dose in milliliters (mL) that you will need to inject based on your body weight. When you receive your vials of GRANIX at the pharmacy, check the label to be sure that the dose strength on the vial matches the dose strength that your healthcare provider prescribed for you. If you are not sure, ask your pharmacist. If you are told that more than 1 injection is needed for each dose of GRANIX, the total dose should be divided into two equal parts. Each of the two parts of your dose should be drawn from a separate vial. Your healthcare provider will show you how to measure the correct dose of GRANIX before you try to inject it for the first time. This dose will be measured in milliliters (mL). How to store your GRANIX vial Store GRANIX in the refrigerator between 36\u00b0F to 46\u00b0F (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Keep GRANIX vials away from light to protect it. If your GRANIX vial comes in a carton, keep it in the carton until you are ready to use it to protect from light. Do not freeze. Take GRANIX out of the refrigerator 30 minutes before use and allow it to reach room temperature before preparing an injection. GRANIX vials can be left at room temperature for a single period of up to 5 days, and if not used can be returned to the refrigerator to use later. Throw away (dispose of) any GRANIX vials that have been left at room temperature for more than 5 days. After you inject your dose, properly dispose of any unused GRANIX left in the vial. Do not save unused GRANIX for later use. Keep GRANIX and all medicines out of the reach of children. Using your vial It is important that you do not try to give the injection unless you or your caregiver has received training from your healthcare provider. Make sure that the name GRANIX appears on the carton and vial label. Check the label and the expiration date on the side of the carton. Do not use a vial after the expiration date on the label. Do not shake the vial. Do not use the vial if the medicine is cloudy or discolored, or contains flakes or particles. Do not inject your first dose of GRANIX until at least 24 hours after you receive your chemotherapy. You should continue to receive GRANIX daily until your healthcare provider tells you that your white blood cell count has returned to normal. Do not inject GRANIX less than 24 hours before your next dose of chemotherapy. Call your healthcare provider if you have any questions. Follow the steps below for each day of dosing STEP 1: Prepare Step 1A: Remove GRANIX from the refrigerator Take the GRANIX \u00ae (tbo-filgrastim) carton out of the refrigerator. Open the carton by lifting the lid and breaking the seal. Step 1B: Check the label and the expiration date on the carton Check to make sure \"GRANIX \u00ae (tbo-filgrastim)\u201d is listed on the carton Do not use if the expiration date on the carton has passed Remove the number of vials needed for the daily dose. Return the carton containing any unused vials to the refrigerator. Step 1C: Wait 30 minutes for the vials to reach room temperature. Place the vials of GRANIX on a clean, well-lit flat work surface for about 30 minutes to warm to room temperature. This will help to provide a more comfortable injection. Do not try to warm the vial by using a heat source such as hot water or microwave Protect the vial from light Do not shake the vial Use a vial only 1 time. Step 1D: Inspect the vial Hold each vial and check to make sure it is not damaged. Inspect the medicine in the vial. Make sure the medicine in the vial is clear and colorless. Check to make sure GRANIX is listed on the vial label. Do not use the vial if: The medicine is cloudy or discolored, or contains flakes or particles. The expiration date on the vial label has passed In these cases, use a new vial and call your healthcare provider. Step 1E: Gather the following supplies needed for each injection and place them on your clean work surface (Figure A): 1 GRANIX vial 1 disposable syringe and needles 2 alcohol swabs 1 cotton balls or gauze pad(s) 1 adhesive bandage(s), if needed 1 sharps disposal container Only use disposable syringes and needles that your healthcare provider prescribes. Only use the syringes and needles 1 time. Throw away (dispose of) any used syringes and needles in a sharps disposal container. You should only use syringes that are marked in tenths of milliliters (mL). Your healthcare provider will show you how to measure the correct dose of GRANIX. This dose will be measured in milliliters (mL). Step 1F: Wash your hands. When ready to inject, wash your hands well with soap and water, and dry with a clean towel. Step 2: Get ready Step 2A: Take the cap off the vial (Figure B). Clean the rubber stopper with 1 alcohol swab. Step 2B: Check the packaging for the syringe and needle . If the packaging has been open or damaged, do not use that syringe and needle. Throw away (dispose of) that syringe and needle in your sharps disposal container. Step 2C: Hold the syringe by the barrel with the needle cap pointing up. Carefully pull the needle cap straight off and away from your body (Figure C). Important: Throw away (Dispose of) the needle cap. Step 2D: Keep the vial on the flat work surface and insert the needle straight down through the rubber stopper on top of the vial. Do not insert the needle through the rubber stopper more than 1 time (Figure D). Step 2E: Push the plunger down and inject all the air from the syringe into the vial of GRANIX (Figure D) Step 2F: Keep the needle in the vial and turn the vial upside down. Make sure that the GRANIX liquid is covering the tip of the needle (Figure E). Step 2G: Keep the vial upside down and slowly pull back on the plunger to fill the syringe barrel with GRANIX to the correct marking amount (mL) of medicine that matches the dose your healthcare provider prescribed. Step 2H: Keep the needle in the vial and check for air bubbles in the syringe. If there are air bubbles, gently tap the syringe barrel with your finger until the air bubbles rise to the top. Slowly push the plunger up to push the air bubbles out of the syringe (Figure F). Step 2I: Keep the tip of the needle in the liquid and pull the plunger back to the number on the syringe barrel that matches your dose. Check again for air bubbles. The air in the syringe will not hurt you, but too large an air bubble can reduce your dose of GRANIX. If there are still air bubbles, repeat the steps above to remove them. Step 2J: Check again to make sure that you have the correct dose in the syringe. It is important that you use the exact dose prescribed by your healthcare provider. Do not remove the needle from the vial. Lay the vial down on its side with the needle still in the vial while you prepare the injection site (Figure G). Step 3 \u2013 Select and prepare the injection site Step 3A: Choose an injection site (Figure H) You can use: Stomach-area (abdomen): Except for a 2 -inch area around the navel (belly button) Thighs: Top or middle area of thighs Arms: Fleshy areas on upper, back part of the arm ( only if someone else is giving you the injection) Upper outer area of your buttocks: Fleshy areas around the back of the upper hips and upper sides of the buttocks ( only if someone else if giving you the injection ). If 2 injections will be performed, then the second injection should be at least 1 inch away from the first injection. Choose Injection Site Figure H Do not inject into areas that are tender, red, bruised, hard, or have scars or stretch marks. Important: You should select a different injection site each time you give yourself an injection. If you want to use the same injection site for a dose requiring 2 injections, make sure the second injection site is at least 1 inch away from the first injection site. Step 3B: Clean the injection site using a new alcohol swab (Figure I). Allow site to dry for 5-10 seconds to avoid stinging. If giving 2 injections, then the distance between the 2 injection sites should be at least 1 inch apart. Do not touch this area again before injecting. Step 4 \u2013Inject medication Step 4A: Remove the prepared syringe and needle from the vial. Step 4B: With your other hand, pinch the skin around the injection site to create a firm surface (Figure J). Important: Keep skin pinched while inserting the needle. Step 4C: Insert the needle at a 45 to 90 degree angle (Figure K) Hold the body of the syringe between your thumb and index finger. Use a quick motion to fully insert the needle straight into the pinched skin at a 45 to 90 degree angle. When the needle is inserted, you can release the pinched skin. Do not hold or push on the plunger while inserting the needle into the skin. Step 4D Push the plunger down to inject all of the GRANIX (Figure L) Use your finger to gently push down on the plunger. When the plunger head is as far down as it will go, all of the GRANIX has been injected. When done, gently remove the needle from the skin. Step 4E: Throw away (d ispose of) used needle and syringe Put your used needles and syringes in a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container right away after use. Do not throw away (dispose of) loose needles and syringes in your household trash. If you do not have a FDA-cleared sharps disposal container, you may use a household container that is: made of a heavy-duty plastic, can be closed with a tight-fitting, puncture-resistant lid, without sharps being able to come out, upright and stable during use, leak-resistant, and properly labeled to warn of hazardous waste inside the container. When your sharps disposal container is almost full, you will need to follow your community guidelines for the right way to dispose of your sharps disposal container. There may be state or local laws about how you should throw away used needles and syringes. For more information about safe sharps disposal, and for specific information about sharps disposal in the state that you live in, go to the FDA\u2019s website at: http://www.fda.gov/safesharpsdisposal . Do not dispose of your used sharps disposal container in your household trash unless your community guidelines permit this. Do not recycle your used sharps disposal container. Step 4F: Treat the injection site if needed and wash your hands. If you see drops of blood at the injection site, you can press a cotton ball or gauze over the injection site for several seconds to stop the bleeding. Apply bandage, if needed. When you are finished, wash your hands with soap and water (Figure M). Step 4G: Repeat steps 1E through 4F with a new vial of GRANIX if your healthcare provider instructs you that your dose is more than 1 vial. If you have any questions or concerns about your dose of GRANIX or how to prepare and give your injections, call your healthcare provider.
