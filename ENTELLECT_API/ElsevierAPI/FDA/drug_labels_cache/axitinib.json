Important Administration Instructions Advise patients to swallow INLYTA whole with a full glass of water. If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken. Advise the patient to take the next prescribed dose at the usual time. 2.2 Dose Modification Guidelines Dose increase or reduction is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. Recommended INLYTA dosage increases and reductions are provided in Table 1. Over the course of treatment, patients who tolerate INLYTA for at least two consecutive weeks with no adverse reactions Grade >2 (according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]), are normotensive, and are not receiving anti-hypertension medication, may have their dose increased. Table 1: Recommended Dosage Increases and Reductions for INLYTA Dose Modification Dose Regimen Recommended starting dosage 5 mg twice daily Dosage increase First dose increase 7 mg twice daily Second dose increase 10 mg twice daily Dosage reduction for management of adverse drug reactions First dose reduction from 5 mg twice daily 3 mg twice daily Second dose reduction 2 mg twice daily Recommended dosage modifications for adverse reactions for INLYTA are provided in Table 2. Table 2: Recommended Dosage Modification for INLYTA for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Severity Dosage Modifications for INLYTA Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] SBP >150 mmHg or DBP >100 mmHg despite antihypertensive treatment \u2022 Reduce dose by one level. SBP >160 mmHg or DBP >105 mmHg \u2022 Withhold until BP <150/100 mmHg. \u2022 Resume at a reduced dose. Grade 4 or hypertensive crisis \u2022 Permanently discontinue. Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Grade 3 or 4 \u2022 Withhold until resolution to Grade 0 or 1 or baseline. \u2022 Either resume at a reduced dose or discontinue depending on the severity and persistence of adverse reaction. Cardiac failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Asymptomatic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 20% but less than 50% below baseline or below the lower limit of normal if baseline was not obtained) \u2022 Withhold until resolution to Grade 0 or 1 or baseline. \u2022 Resume at a reduced dose. Clinically manifested congestive heart failure \u2022 Permanently discontinue. Impaired wound healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Any Grade \u2022 The safety of resumption of INLYTA after resolution of wound healing has not been established. \u2022 Either resume at a reduced dose or discontinue depending on the severity and persistence of the adverse reaction. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Any Grade \u2022 Permanently discontinue. Proteinuria [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] 2 or more grams proteinuria per 24 hours \u2022 Withhold until resolution to less than 2 grams per 24 hours. \u2022 Resume at a reduced dose.

Table 3 represents additional recommended dosage modifications for adverse reactions when INLYTA is administered in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab. See the Full Prescribing Information for additional dosage information for avelumab or pembrolizumab including dose modifications for immune-mediated adverse reactions. Table 3: Recommended Dosage Modification for Adverse Reactions for INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab or Pembrolizumab Treatment Adverse Reaction Severity Based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dosage Modifications for INLYTA ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, ULN = upper limit normal INLYTA in combination with avelumab OR pembrolizumab Liver enzyme elevations Consider corticosteroid therapy ALT or AST at least 3 times ULN but less than 10 times ULN without concurrent total bilirubin at least 2 times ULN \u2022 Withhold both INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab until resolution to Grades 0\u20131 \u2022 Consider rechallenge with INLYTA and/or avelumab or pembrolizumab If rechallenging with INLYTA, consider dosage reduction per Table 1. Consider rechallenge with a single drug or sequential rechallenge with both drugs after recovery. ALT or AST increases to more than 3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin at least 2 times ULN or ALT or AST at least 10 times ULN \u2022 Permanently discontinue both INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab Diarrhea Grade 1\u20132 \u2022 Initiate symptomatic medications. Grade 3 \u2022 Interrupt INLYTA and initiate symptomatic medications. If diarrhea is controlled, INLYTA may be resumed at either the same dose or reduced by 1 dose level. Grade 4 \u2022 Withhold INLYTA until resolution to Grade <2, then restart INLYTA dose reduced by 1 dose level INLYTA in combination with avelumab Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) Grade 3 or 4 \u2022 Permanently discontinue 2.3 Dosage Modification for Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be avoided (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole). Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended. Although INLYTA dose adjustment has not been studied in patients receiving strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, if a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, a dose decrease of INLYTA by approximately half is recommended, as this dose reduction is predicted to adjust the axitinib area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) to the range observed without inhibitors. The subsequent doses can be increased or decreased based on individual safety and tolerability. If co-administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the INLYTA dose should be returned (after 3 \u2013 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to that used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Modification for Hepatic Impairment No starting dose adjustment is required when administering INLYTA to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the INLYTA starting dose should be reduced by approximately half in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). The subsequent doses can be increased or decreased based on individual safety and tolerability. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypertension: Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood pressure should be well-controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor for hypertension and treat as needed. Withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Events: Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk for these events. Permanently discontinue INLYTA if an arterial thromboembolic event occurs during treatment. Withhold INLYTA and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE. ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. Withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA or discontinue based on severity and persistence of hemorrhage. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Cardiac Failure: Cardiac failure has been observed and can be fatal. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require dose reduction, dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of INLYTA. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula Formation: Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold INLYTA for at least 2 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. Resume INLYTA at a reduced dose or discontinue based on severity and persistence of the impaired wound healing. The safety of resumption of INLYTA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): RPLS has been observed. Permanently discontinue INLYTA if signs or symptoms of RPLS occur. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Proteinuria: Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. For moderate to severe proteinuria, withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Liver enzyme elevation has occurred during treatment with INLYTA as a single agent. Monitor ALT, AST and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. When used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevation may occur. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes. Withhold INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab, initiate corticosteroid therapy as needed, and/or permanently discontinue the combination for severe or life-threatening hepatotoxicity. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Decrease the starting dose of INLYTA if used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 , 5.12 ) \u2022 Major adverse cardiovascular events (INLYTA in combination with avelumab): Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors. Permanently discontinue INLYTA in combination with avelumab for Grade 3\u20134 events. ( 5.13 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: INLYTA can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.14 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hypertension In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hypertension was reported in 145/359 patients (40%) receiving INLYTA and 103/355 patients (29%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 hypertension was observed in 56/359 patients (16%) receiving INLYTA and 39/355 patients (11%) receiving sorafenib. Hypertensive crisis was reported in 2/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. The median onset time for hypertension (systolic blood pressure >150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >100 mmHg) was within the first month of the start of INLYTA treatment and blood pressure increases have been observed as early as 4 days after starting INLYTA. Hypertension was managed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. Discontinuation of INLYTA treatment due to hypertension occurred in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Ensure that blood pressure is well-controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor patients for hypertension and treat as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. Withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.2 Arterial Thromboembolic Events In clinical trials, arterial thromboembolic events have been reported, including deaths. In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, Grade 3/4 arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 4/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 4/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal cerebrovascular accident was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . INLYTA has not been studied in patients who had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 12 months. In clinical trials with INLYTA, arterial thromboembolic events (including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, and retinal artery occlusion) were reported in 17/715 patients (2%), with two deaths secondary to cerebrovascular accident. Permanently discontinue INLYTA if an arterial thromboembolic event occurs during treatment. 5.3 Venous Thromboembolic Events In clinical trials, venous thromboembolic events have been reported, including deaths. In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 11/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA and 2/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events were reported in 9/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA (including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion and retinal vein thrombosis) and 2/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal pulmonary embolism was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. INLYTA has not been studied in patients who had a venous thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. In clinical trials with INLYTA, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 22/715 patients (3%), with two deaths secondary to pulmonary embolism. Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE. Withhold INLYTA and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE. 5.4 Hemorrhage In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hemorrhagic events were reported in 58/359 patients (16%) receiving INLYTA and 64/355 patients (18%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 hemorrhagic events were reported in 5/359 (1%) patients receiving INLYTA (including cerebral hemorrhage, hematuria, hemoptysis, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and melena) and 11/355 (3%) patients receiving sorafenib. Fatal hemorrhage was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA (gastric hemorrhage) and 3/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. INLYTA has not been studied in patients who have evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. Withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA or discontinue based on severity and persistence of hemorrhage. 5.5 Cardiac Failure In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, cardiac failure was reported in 6/359 patients (2%) receiving INLYTA and 3/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 cardiac failure was observed in 2/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 1/355 patients (<1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal cardiac failure was reported in 2/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 1/355 patients (<1%) receiving sorafenib. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require dose reduction, dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of INLYTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula Formation In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. In clinical trials with INLYTA, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 5/715 patients (1%), including one death. In addition to cases of gastrointestinal perforation, fistulas were reported in 4/715 patients (1%). Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment with INLYTA. 5.7 Thyroid Dysfunction In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hypothyroidism was reported in 69/359 patients (19%) receiving INLYTA and 29/355 patients (8%) receiving sorafenib. Hyperthyroidism was reported in 4/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 4/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. In patients who had thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) <5 \u03bcU/mL before treatment, elevations of TSH to \u226510 \u03bcU/mL occurred in 79/245 patients (32%) receiving INLYTA and 25/232 patients (11%) receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. Treat hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism according to standard medical practice to maintain euthyroid state. 5.8 Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, INLYTA has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold INLYTA for at least 2 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. Resume INLYTA at a reduced dose or discontinue based on severity and persistence of the impaired wound healing. The safety of resumption of INLYTA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.9 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . There were two additional reports of RPLS in other clinical trials with INLYTA. RPLS is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RPLS. Permanently discontinue INLYTA in patients developing RPLS. The safety of reinitiating INLYTA therapy in patients previously experiencing RPLS is not known [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.10 Proteinuria In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, proteinuria was reported in 39/359 patients (11%) receiving INLYTA and 26/355 patients (7%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 11/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA and 6/355 patients (2%) receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitoring for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA is recommended. For patients who develop moderate to severe proteinuria, withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.11 Hepatotoxicity INLYTA as a Single Agent In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations of all grades occurred in 22% of patients on both arms, with Grade 3/4 events in <1% of patients on the INLYTA arm. When used as a single agent, monitor ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment with INLYTA. INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab or with Pembrolizumab INLYTA in combination with avelumab or with pembrolizumab can cause hepatotoxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt or permanently discontinue INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab, and administer corticosteroids as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . With the combination of INLYTA and avelumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and increased AST were reported in 9% and 7% of patients, respectively. In patients with ALT \u22653 times ULN (Grades 2\u20134, n=82), ALT resolved to Grades 0\u20131 in 92%. Among the 73 patients who were rechallenged with either avelumab (n=3) or axitinib (n=25) administered as a single agent or with both (n=45), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in no patient receiving avelumab, 6 patients receiving INLYTA, and 15 patients receiving both avelumab and INLYTA . Twenty-two (88%) patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered to Grade 0\u20131 from the event. Immune-mediated hepatitis was reported in 7% of patients including 4.9% with Grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatotoxicity led to permanent discontinuation in 7% and immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of either avelumab or INLYTA in 5% of patients. Thirty-four patients were treated with corticosteroids and one patient was treated with a non-steroidal immunosuppressant. Resolution of hepatitis occurred in 31 of the 35 patients at the time of data cut-off. With the combination of INLYTA and pembrolizumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times ULN (Grades 2\u20134, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0\u20131 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either pembrolizumab (n=3) or INLYTA (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving pembrolizumab, 16 patients receiving INLYTA, and 24 patients receiving both pembrolizumab and INLYTA. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. 5.12 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The systemic exposure to axitinib was higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. A dose decrease is recommended when administering INLYTA to patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.13 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) INLYTA in combination with avelumab can cause severe and fatal cardiovascular events. Consider baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular events. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Permanently discontinue INLYTA and avelumab for Grade 3\u20134 cardiovascular events. MACE occurred in 7% of patients with advanced RCC treated with INLYTA in combination with avelumab compared to 3.4% treated with sunitinib in a randomized trial, JAVELIN Renal 101. These events included death due to cardiac events (1.4%), Grade 3\u20134 myocardial infarction (2.8%), and Grade 3\u20134 congestive heart failure (1.8%). Median time to onset of MACE was 4.2 months (range: 2 days to 24.5 months). 5.14 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available human data to inform the drug-associated risk. In developmental toxicity studies in mice, axitinib was teratogenic, embryotoxic and fetotoxic at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended clinical dose. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with INLYTA and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with INLYTA and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for pregnancy and contraception information."

The most common adverse reactions (>1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of avelumab or the combination were hepatotoxicity (6%) and infusion-related reaction (1.8%). Dose interruptions or reductions due to an adverse reaction, excluding temporary interruptions of avelumab infusions due to infusion-related reactions, occurred in 76% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab. This includes interruption of avelumab in 50% of patients. INLYTA was interrupted in 66% and dose reduced in 19% of patients. The most common adverse reaction (>10%) resulting in interruption of avelumab was diarrhea (10%). The most common adverse reactions resulting in either interruption or dose reduction of INLYTA were diarrhea (19%), hypertension (18%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (18%), and hepatotoxicity (10%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab were diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, mucositis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, dysphonia, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism, rash, hepatotoxicity, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and headache. Forty-eight (11%) of patients treated with INLYTA in combination with avelumab received an oral prednisone dose equivalent to \u226540 mg daily for an immune-mediated adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Table 4 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in \u226520% of INLYTA in combination with avelumab-treated patients.

( 7.2 ) 7.1 CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors Co-administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, increased the plasma exposure of axitinib in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of INLYTA with strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be avoided. Grapefruit or grapefruit juice may also increase axitinib plasma concentrations and should be avoided. Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended. If a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, the INLYTA dose should be reduced [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 7.2 CYP3A4/5 Inducers Co-administration of rifampin, a strong inducer of CYP3A4/5, reduced the plasma exposure of axitinib in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of INLYTA with strong CYP3A4/5 inducers (e.g., rifampin, dexamethasone, phenytoin, carbamazepine, rifabutin, rifapentine, phenobarbital, and St. John's wort) should be avoided. Selection of concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 induction potential is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . Moderate CYP3A4/5 inducers (e.g., bosentan, efavirenz, etravirine, modafinil, and nafcillin) may also reduce the plasma exposure of axitinib and should be avoided if possible."

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action, INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available human data to inform the drug-associated risk. In developmental toxicity studies, axitinib was teratogenic, embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended starting dose (see Data ) . Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the United States (U.S.) general population of major birth defects is 2%\u20134% and of miscarriage is 15%\u201320% of clinically recognized pregnancies. When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for pregnancy information. Data Animal Data Oral axitinib administered twice daily to female mice prior to mating and through the first week of pregnancy caused an increase in post-implantation loss at all doses tested (\u226515 mg/kg/dose, approximately 10 times the systemic exposure (AUC) in patients at the recommended starting dose). In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, pregnant mice received oral doses of 0.15, 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg/dose axitinib twice daily during the period of organogenesis. Embryo-fetal toxicities observed in the absence of maternal toxicity included malformation (cleft palate) at 1.5 mg/kg/dose (approximately 0.5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose) and variation in skeletal ossification at \u22650.5 mg/kg/dose (approximately 0.15 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of axitinib in human milk, or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from INLYTA, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose. When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for lactation information. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings in animal studies, INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for contraception information. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with INLYTA. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with INLYTA and for 1 week after the last dose. Males Based on findings in animal studies, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility Females and Males Based on findings in animals, INLYTA may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of INLYTA in pediatric patients have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of INLYTA were assessed, but not established, in two open label studies: a dose finding study of INLYTA as a single agent in 17 pediatric patients aged 5 to <17 years with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (ADVL1315, NCT02164838) and a randomized study of INLYTA as a single agent or in combination in 7 pediatric patients aged 7 to <17 years (AREN1721, NCT03595124). No new safety signals were observed with INLYTA in pediatric patients across these studies. Exposure in pediatric patients who received INLYTA at the maximum tolerated dosage were lower than those previously observed in adults who received the approved recommended starting dosage. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Toxicities in bone and teeth were observed in immature mice and dogs administered oral axitinib twice daily for 1 month or longer. Effects in bone consisted of thickened growth plates in mice and dogs at \u226515 mg/kg/dose (approximately 6 and 15 times, respectively, the systemic exposure (AUC) in patients at the recommended starting dose). Abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (including dental caries, malocclusions and broken and/or missing teeth) were observed in mice administered oral axitinib twice daily at \u22655 mg/kg/dose (approximately 1.5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose). Other toxicities of potential concern to pediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals. 8.5 Geriatric Use In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, 123/359 patients (34%) treated with INLYTA were \u226565 years of age. Although greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out, no overall differences were observed in the safety and effectiveness of INLYTA between patients who were \u226565 years of age and younger. Of the 434 patients randomized to INLYTA 5 mg twice daily administered in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg in the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial, 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety or efficacy was reported between patients who were \u226565 years of age and younger. Of the 432 patients randomized to INLYTA 5 mg twice daily administered in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg in the KEYNOTE-426 trial, 40% were 65 years or older. No overall difference in safety or efficacy was reported between patients who were \u226565 years of age and younger. No dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment In a dedicated hepatic impairment trial, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, systemic exposure following a single dose of INLYTA was similar in subjects with baseline mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) and higher in subjects with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). No starting dose adjustment is required when administering INLYTA to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). A starting dose decrease is recommended when administering INLYTA to patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . INLYTA has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 8.7 Renal Impairment No dedicated renal impairment trial for axitinib has been conducted. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses, no significant difference in axitinib clearance was observed in patients with pre-existing mild to severe renal impairment (15 mL/min \u2264creatinine clearance [CLcr] <89 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No starting dose adjustment is needed for patients with pre-existing mild to severe renal impairment. Caution should be used in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min)."

In developmental toxicity studies, axitinib was teratogenic, embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended starting dose (see Data ) . Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the United States (U.S.) general population of major birth defects is 2%\u20134% and of miscarriage is 15%\u201320% of clinically recognized pregnancies. When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for pregnancy information. Data Animal Data Oral axitinib administered twice daily to female mice prior to mating and through the first week of pregnancy caused an increase in post-implantation loss at all doses tested (\u226515 mg/kg/dose, approximately 10 times the systemic exposure (AUC) in patients at the recommended starting dose). In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, pregnant mice received oral doses of 0.15, 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg/dose axitinib twice daily during the period of organogenesis. Embryo-fetal toxicities observed in the absence of maternal toxicity included malformation (cleft palate) at 1.5 mg/kg/dose (approximately 0.5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose) and variation in skeletal ossification at \u22650.5 mg/kg/dose (approximately 0.15 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Axitinib has been shown to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression. VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation and survival were inhibited by axitinib in vitro and in mouse models. Axitinib was shown to inhibit tumor growth and phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in tumor xenograft mouse models. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of a single oral dose of INLYTA (5 mg) in the absence and presence of 400 mg ketoconazole on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-blinded, two-way crossover study in 35 healthy subjects. No large changes in mean QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) from placebo were detected up to 3 hours post-dose. However, small increases in mean QTc interval (i.e., <10 ms) cannot be ruled out. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The population pharmacokinetic analysis pooled data from 17 trials in healthy subjects and patients with cancer. A two-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and lag-time adequately describes the axitinib concentration-time profile. Absorption and Distribution Following single oral 5-mg dose administration, the median Tmax ranged from 2.5 to 4.1 hours. Based on the plasma half-life, steady state is expected within 2 to 3 days of dosing. Dosing of axitinib at 5 mg twice daily resulted in approximately 1.4-fold accumulation compared to administration of a single dose. At steady state, axitinib exhibits approximately linear pharmacokinetics within the 1-mg to 20-mg dose range. The mean absolute bioavailability of axitinib after an oral 5 mg dose is 58%. Compared to overnight fasting, administration of INLYTA with a moderate fat meal resulted in 10% lower AUC and a high fat, high-calorie meal resulted in 19% higher AUC. INLYTA can be administered with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Axitinib is highly bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins with preferential binding to albumin and moderate binding to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. In patients with advanced RCC (n=20), at the 5 mg twice daily dose in the fed state, the geometric mean (CV%) C max and AUC 0\u201324 were 27.8 (79%) ng/mL and 265 (77%) ng.h/mL, respectively. The geometric mean (CV%) clearance and apparent volume of distribution were 38 (80%) L/h and 160 (105%) L, respectively. Metabolism and Elimination The plasma half-life of INLYTA ranges from 2.5 to 6.1 hours. Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1. Following oral administration of a 5-mg radioactive dose of axitinib, approximately 41% of the radioactivity was recovered in feces and approximately 23% was recovered in urine. Unchanged axitinib, accounting for 12% of the dose, was the major component identified in feces. Unchanged axitinib was not detected in urine; the carboxylic acid and sulfoxide metabolites accounted for the majority of radioactivity in urine. In plasma, the N-glucuronide metabolite represented the predominant radioactive component (50% of circulating radioactivity) and unchanged axitinib and the sulfoxide metabolite each accounted for approximately 20% of the circulating radioactivity. The sulfoxide and N-glucuronide metabolites show approximately \u2265400-fold less in vitro potency against VEGFR-2 compared to axitinib. Drug-Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on INLYTA Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4/5. Additionally, the aqueous solubility of axitinib is pH dependent, with higher pH resulting in lower solubility. The effects of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer, and an antacid on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib are presented in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Figure 1. Impact of Co-administered Drugs and Hepatic Impairment on Axitinib Pharmacokinetics Figure 1 Effects of INLYTA on Other Drugs In vitro studies demonstrated that axitinib has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. However, co-administration of axitinib with paclitaxel, a CYP2C8 substrate, did not increase plasma concentrations of paclitaxel in patients. In vitro studies indicated that axitinib does not inhibit CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, or UGT1A1 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. In vitro studies in human hepatocytes indicated that axitinib does not induce CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP3A4/5. Axitinib is an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro. However, INLYTA is not expected to inhibit P-gp at therapeutic plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib are presented in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Population pharmacokinetic analysis (based on pre-existing renal function) was carried out in 590 healthy volunteers and patients, including five with severe renal impairment (15 mL/min \u2264CLcr <29 mL/min), 64 with moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min \u2264CLcr <59 mL/min), and 139 with mild renal impairment (60 mL/min \u2264CLcr <89 mL/min). Mild to severe renal impairment did not have meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib. Data from only one patient with end-stage renal disease are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Other Intrinsic Factors Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body weight, body surface area, UGT1A1 genotype, or CYP2C19 genotype on the clearance of axitinib. INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab When INLYTA 5 mg was administered in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg, the respective exposures of INLYTA and avelumab were comparable to the single agents. There was no evidence to suggest a clinically relevant change of avelumab clearance over time in patients with advanced RCC.

Patients with autoimmune disease or conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded. Randomization was stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) (0 vs. 1) and region (United States vs. Canada/Western Europe vs. the rest of the world). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: \u2022 INLYTA 5 mg twice daily orally was given in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (N=442). Patients who tolerated INLYTA 5 mg twice daily without Grade 2 or greater INLYTA-related adverse events for 2 consecutive weeks could increase to 7 mg and then subsequently to 10 mg twice daily. INLYTA could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity. \u2022 Sunitinib 50 mg once daily orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off (N=444) until radiographic or clinical progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with INLYTA and avelumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) assessment or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of INLYTA and avelumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline, after randomization at 6 weeks, then every 6 weeks thereafter up to 18 months after randomization, and every 12 weeks thereafter until documented confirmed disease progression by BICR. Baseline characteristics were a median age of 61 years (range: 27 to 88), 38% of patients were 65 years or older, 75% were male, 75% were White, and the ECOG PS was 0 (63%) or 1 (37%), respectively. Patient distribution by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database (IMDC) risk groups was 21% favorable, 62% intermediate, and 16% poor. The major efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by an BICR using RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS) in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors using a clinical trial assay (PD-L1 expression level \u22651%). Since PFS was statistically significant in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors [HR 0.61 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.79)], it was then tested in the ITT population and a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the ITT population was also demonstrated. With a median overall survival follow-up of 19 months, overall survival data were immature with 27% deaths in the ITT population. Efficacy results are presented in Table 10 and Figure 2.

K-M Estimates for PFS Based on BICR Assessment - ITT Figure 2 INLYTA in Combination with Pembrolizumab The efficacy of INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-426 (NCT02853331), a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial conducted in 861 patients who had not received systemic therapy for advanced RCC. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression within the last 2 years were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk categories (favorable versus intermediate versus poor) and geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus \"Rest of the World\"). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: \u2022 INLYTA 5 mg orally, twice daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months. Patients who tolerated INLYTA 5 mg twice daily for 2 consecutive cycles (6 weeks) could increase to 7 mg and then subsequently to 10 mg twice daily. INLYTA could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity. \u2022 Sunitinib 50 mg orally, once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks. Treatment with INLYTA and pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of INLYTA and pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline, after randomization at Week 12, then every 6 weeks thereafter until Week 54, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 26 to 90); 38% age 65 or older; 73% male; 79% White and 16% Asian; 20% and 80% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; and patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 31% favorable, 56% intermediate and 13% poor. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR, as assessed by BICR. A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated at the first pre-specified interim analysis in patients randomized to INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab compared with sunitinib. The trial also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and ORR. An updated OS analysis was conducted when 418 deaths were observed based on the planned number of deaths for the pre-specified final analysis. Table 11 and Figure 3 summarize the efficacy results for KEYNOTE-426.

Kaplan-Meier Curve for Overall Survival in KEYNOTE-426 In an exploratory analysis, the updated analysis of OS in patients with IMDC favorable, intermediate, intermediate/poor, and poor risk demonstrated a HR of 1.17 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.80), 0.67 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.86), 0.64 (95% CI: 0.52, 0.80), and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.81), respectively. Figure 3 14.2 Second-Line Advanced RCC The safety and efficacy of INLYTA were evaluated in a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study. Patients (N=723) with advanced RCC whose disease had progressed on or after treatment with 1 prior systemic therapy, including sunitinib-, bevacizumab-, temsirolimus-, or cytokine-containing regimens were randomized (1:1) to receive INLYTA (N=361) or sorafenib (N=362). Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by a blinded independent central review committee. Other endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Of the patients enrolled in this study, 389 patients (54%) had received 1 prior sunitinib-based therapy, 251 patients (35%) had received 1 prior cytokine-based therapy (interleukin-2 or interferon-alfa), 59 patients (8%) had received 1 prior bevacizumab-based therapy, and 24 patients (3%) had received 1 prior temsirolimus-based therapy. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the INLYTA and sorafenib groups with regard to age (median 61 years), gender (72% male), race (75% white, 21% Asian), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (55% 0, 45% 1), and histology (99% clear cell). There was a statistically significant advantage for INLYTA over sorafenib for the endpoint of PFS (see Table 12 and Figure 4 ). There was no statistically significant difference between the arms in OS.

Second-Line Advanced RCC When INLYTA is used as a single agent, the recommended starting oral dose is 5 mg twice daily. Administer INLYTA doses approximately 12 hours apart with or without food. Important Administration Instructions Advise patients to swallow INLYTA whole with a full glass of water. If the patient vomits or misses a dose, an additional dose should not be taken. Advise the patient to take the next prescribed dose at the usual time. 2.2 Dose Modification Guidelines Dose increase or reduction is recommended based on individual safety and tolerability. Recommended INLYTA dosage increases and reductions are provided in Table 1. Over the course of treatment, patients who tolerate INLYTA for at least two consecutive weeks with no adverse reactions Grade >2 (according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]), are normotensive, and are not receiving anti-hypertension medication, may have their dose increased. Table 1: Recommended Dosage Increases and Reductions for INLYTA Dose Modification Dose Regimen Recommended starting dosage 5 mg twice daily Dosage increase First dose increase 7 mg twice daily Second dose increase 10 mg twice daily Dosage reduction for management of adverse drug reactions First dose reduction from 5 mg twice daily 3 mg twice daily Second dose reduction 2 mg twice daily Recommended dosage modifications for adverse reactions for INLYTA are provided in Table 2. Table 2: Recommended Dosage Modification for INLYTA for Adverse Reactions Adverse Reaction Severity Dosage Modifications for INLYTA Hypertension [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1) ] SBP >150 mmHg or DBP >100 mmHg despite antihypertensive treatment \u2022 Reduce dose by one level. SBP >160 mmHg or DBP >105 mmHg \u2022 Withhold until BP <150/100 mmHg. \u2022 Resume at a reduced dose. Grade 4 or hypertensive crisis \u2022 Permanently discontinue. Hemorrhage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) ] Grade 3 or 4 \u2022 Withhold until resolution to Grade 0 or 1 or baseline. \u2022 Either resume at a reduced dose or discontinue depending on the severity and persistence of adverse reaction. Cardiac failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5) ] Asymptomatic cardiomyopathy (left ventricular ejection fraction greater than 20% but less than 50% below baseline or below the lower limit of normal if baseline was not obtained) \u2022 Withhold until resolution to Grade 0 or 1 or baseline. \u2022 Resume at a reduced dose. Clinically manifested congestive heart failure \u2022 Permanently discontinue. Impaired wound healing [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8) ] Any Grade \u2022 The safety of resumption of INLYTA after resolution of wound healing has not been established. \u2022 Either resume at a reduced dose or discontinue depending on the severity and persistence of the adverse reaction. Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome [see Warnings and Precautions (5.9) ] Any Grade \u2022 Permanently discontinue. Proteinuria [ see Warnings and Precautions (5.10) ] 2 or more grams proteinuria per 24 hours \u2022 Withhold until resolution to less than 2 grams per 24 hours. \u2022 Resume at a reduced dose. Other Adverse Reactions Grade 3 \u2022 Reduce dosage by one level. Grade 4 \u2022 Withhold until resolution to Grade 2. \u2022 Resume at a reduced dose. Table 3 represents additional recommended dosage modifications for adverse reactions when INLYTA is administered in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab. See the Full Prescribing Information for additional dosage information for avelumab or pembrolizumab including dose modifications for immune-mediated adverse reactions. Table 3: Recommended Dosage Modification for Adverse Reactions for INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab or Pembrolizumab Treatment Adverse Reaction Severity Based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dosage Modifications for INLYTA ALT = alanine aminotransferase, AST = aspartate aminotransferase, ULN = upper limit normal INLYTA in combination with avelumab OR pembrolizumab Liver enzyme elevations Consider corticosteroid therapy ALT or AST at least 3 times ULN but less than 10 times ULN without concurrent total bilirubin at least 2 times ULN \u2022 Withhold both INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab until resolution to Grades 0\u20131 \u2022 Consider rechallenge with INLYTA and/or avelumab or pembrolizumab If rechallenging with INLYTA, consider dosage reduction per Table 1. Consider rechallenge with a single drug or sequential rechallenge with both drugs after recovery. ALT or AST increases to more than 3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin at least 2 times ULN or ALT or AST at least 10 times ULN \u2022 Permanently discontinue both INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab Diarrhea Grade 1\u20132 \u2022 Initiate symptomatic medications. Grade 3 \u2022 Interrupt INLYTA and initiate symptomatic medications. If diarrhea is controlled, INLYTA may be resumed at either the same dose or reduced by 1 dose level. Grade 4 \u2022 Withhold INLYTA until resolution to Grade <2, then restart INLYTA dose reduced by 1 dose level INLYTA in combination with avelumab Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) Grade 3 or 4 \u2022 Permanently discontinue 2.3 Dosage Modification for Drug Interactions Strong CYP3A4/5 Inhibitors The concomitant use of strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be avoided (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, atazanavir, indinavir, nefazodone, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, and voriconazole). Selection of an alternate concomitant medication with no or minimal CYP3A4/5 inhibition potential is recommended. Although INLYTA dose adjustment has not been studied in patients receiving strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, if a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor must be co-administered, a dose decrease of INLYTA by approximately half is recommended, as this dose reduction is predicted to adjust the axitinib area under the plasma concentration vs time curve (AUC) to the range observed without inhibitors. The subsequent doses can be increased or decreased based on individual safety and tolerability. If co-administration of the strong inhibitor is discontinued, the INLYTA dose should be returned (after 3 \u2013 5 half-lives of the inhibitor) to that used prior to initiation of the strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor [see Drug Interactions (7.1) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]. 2.4 Dosage Modification for Hepatic Impairment No starting dose adjustment is required when administering INLYTA to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the INLYTA starting dose should be reduced by approximately half in patients with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). The subsequent doses can be increased or decreased based on individual safety and tolerability. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ]."

      "5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS \u2022 Hypertension: Hypertension including hypertensive crisis has been observed. Blood pressure should be well-controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor for hypertension and treat as needed. Withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension. ( 5.1 ) \u2022 Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Events: Arterial and venous thrombotic events have been observed and can be fatal. Use with caution in patients who are at increased risk for these events. Permanently discontinue INLYTA if an arterial thromboembolic event occurs during treatment. Withhold INLYTA and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE. ( 5.2 , 5.3 ) \u2022 Hemorrhage: Hemorrhagic events, including fatal events, have been reported. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. Withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA or discontinue based on severity and persistence of hemorrhage. ( 5.4 ) \u2022 Cardiac Failure: Cardiac failure has been observed and can be fatal. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require dose reduction, dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of INLYTA. ( 5.5 ) \u2022 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula Formation: Gastrointestinal perforation and fistula, including death, have occurred. Use with caution in patients at risk for gastrointestinal perforation or fistula. ( 5.6 ) \u2022 Hypothyroidism: Hypothyroidism requiring thyroid hormone replacement has been reported. Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. ( 5.7 ) \u2022 Impaired Wound Healing: Withhold INLYTA for at least 2 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. Resume INLYTA at a reduced dose or discontinue based on severity and persistence of the impaired wound healing. The safety of resumption of INLYTA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established. ( 5.8 ) \u2022 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS): RPLS has been observed. Permanently discontinue INLYTA if signs or symptoms of RPLS occur. ( 5.9 ) \u2022 Proteinuria: Monitor for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. For moderate to severe proteinuria, withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA. ( 5.10 ) \u2022 Hepatotoxicity: Liver enzyme elevation has occurred during treatment with INLYTA as a single agent. Monitor ALT, AST and bilirubin before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. When used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, higher frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevation may occur. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes. Withhold INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab, initiate corticosteroid therapy as needed, and/or permanently discontinue the combination for severe or life-threatening hepatotoxicity. ( 5.11 ) \u2022 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment: Decrease the starting dose of INLYTA if used in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment. ( 2.2 , 5.12 ) \u2022 Major adverse cardiovascular events (INLYTA in combination with avelumab): Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors. Permanently discontinue INLYTA in combination with avelumab for Grade 3\u20134 events. ( 5.13 ) \u2022 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: INLYTA can cause fetal harm. Advise patients of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception. ( 5.14 , 8.1 , 8.3 ) 5.1 Hypertension In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hypertension was reported in 145/359 patients (40%) receiving INLYTA and 103/355 patients (29%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 hypertension was observed in 56/359 patients (16%) receiving INLYTA and 39/355 patients (11%) receiving sorafenib. Hypertensive crisis was reported in 2/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. The median onset time for hypertension (systolic blood pressure >150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >100 mmHg) was within the first month of the start of INLYTA treatment and blood pressure increases have been observed as early as 4 days after starting INLYTA. Hypertension was managed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. Discontinuation of INLYTA treatment due to hypertension occurred in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Ensure that blood pressure is well-controlled prior to initiating INLYTA. Monitor patients for hypertension and treat as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. Withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA or permanently discontinue based on severity of hypertension [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.2 Arterial Thromboembolic Events In clinical trials, arterial thromboembolic events have been reported, including deaths. In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, Grade 3/4 arterial thromboembolic events were reported in 4/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 4/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal cerebrovascular accident was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . INLYTA has not been studied in patients who had an arterial thromboembolic event within the previous 12 months. In clinical trials with INLYTA, arterial thromboembolic events (including transient ischemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, and retinal artery occlusion) were reported in 17/715 patients (2%), with two deaths secondary to cerebrovascular accident. Permanently discontinue INLYTA if an arterial thromboembolic event occurs during treatment. 5.3 Venous Thromboembolic Events In clinical trials, venous thromboembolic events have been reported, including deaths. In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 11/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA and 2/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 venous thromboembolic events were reported in 9/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA (including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, retinal vein occlusion and retinal vein thrombosis) and 2/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal pulmonary embolism was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. INLYTA has not been studied in patients who had a venous thromboembolic event within the previous 6 months. In clinical trials with INLYTA, venous thromboembolic events were reported in 22/715 patients (3%), with two deaths secondary to pulmonary embolism. Monitor for signs and symptoms of VTE and PE. Withhold INLYTA and then resume at same dose or permanently discontinue based on severity of VTE. 5.4 Hemorrhage In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hemorrhagic events were reported in 58/359 patients (16%) receiving INLYTA and 64/355 patients (18%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 hemorrhagic events were reported in 5/359 (1%) patients receiving INLYTA (including cerebral hemorrhage, hematuria, hemoptysis, lower gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and melena) and 11/355 (3%) patients receiving sorafenib. Fatal hemorrhage was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA (gastric hemorrhage) and 3/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. INLYTA has not been studied in patients who have evidence of untreated brain metastasis or recent active gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be used in those patients. Withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA or discontinue based on severity and persistence of hemorrhage. 5.5 Cardiac Failure In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, cardiac failure was reported in 6/359 patients (2%) receiving INLYTA and 3/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3/4 cardiac failure was observed in 2/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 1/355 patients (<1%) receiving sorafenib. Fatal cardiac failure was reported in 2/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 1/355 patients (<1%) receiving sorafenib. Monitor for signs or symptoms of cardiac failure throughout treatment with INLYTA. Management of cardiac failure may require dose reduction, dose interruption or permanent discontinuation of INLYTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.6 Gastrointestinal Perforation and Fistula Formation In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib. In clinical trials with INLYTA, gastrointestinal perforation was reported in 5/715 patients (1%), including one death. In addition to cases of gastrointestinal perforation, fistulas were reported in 4/715 patients (1%). Monitor for symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula periodically throughout treatment with INLYTA. 5.7 Thyroid Dysfunction In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, hypothyroidism was reported in 69/359 patients (19%) receiving INLYTA and 29/355 patients (8%) receiving sorafenib. Hyperthyroidism was reported in 4/359 patients (1%) receiving INLYTA and 4/355 patients (1%) receiving sorafenib. In patients who had thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) <5 \u03bcU/mL before treatment, elevations of TSH to \u226510 \u03bcU/mL occurred in 79/245 patients (32%) receiving INLYTA and 25/232 patients (11%) receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitor thyroid function before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA. Treat hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism according to standard medical practice to maintain euthyroid state. 5.8 Impaired Wound Healing Impaired wound healing can occur in patients who receive drugs that inhibit the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway. Therefore, INLYTA has the potential to adversely affect wound healing. Withhold INLYTA for at least 2 days prior to elective surgery. Do not administer for at least 2 weeks following major surgery and until adequate wound healing. Resume INLYTA at a reduced dose or discontinue based on severity and persistence of the impaired wound healing. The safety of resumption of INLYTA after resolution of wound healing complications has not been established [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.9 Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) was reported in 1/359 patients (<1%) receiving INLYTA and none of the patients receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . There were two additional reports of RPLS in other clinical trials with INLYTA. RPLS is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. Magnetic resonance imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of RPLS. Permanently discontinue INLYTA in patients developing RPLS. The safety of reinitiating INLYTA therapy in patients previously experiencing RPLS is not known [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.10 Proteinuria In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, proteinuria was reported in 39/359 patients (11%) receiving INLYTA and 26/355 patients (7%) receiving sorafenib. Grade 3 proteinuria was reported in 11/359 patients (3%) receiving INLYTA and 6/355 patients (2%) receiving sorafenib [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] . Monitoring for proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout, treatment with INLYTA is recommended. For patients who develop moderate to severe proteinuria, withhold and then dose reduce INLYTA [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) ] . 5.11 Hepatotoxicity INLYTA as a Single Agent In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevations of all grades occurred in 22% of patients on both arms, with Grade 3/4 events in <1% of patients on the INLYTA arm. When used as a single agent, monitor ALT, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and bilirubin before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment with INLYTA. INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab or with Pembrolizumab INLYTA in combination with avelumab or with pembrolizumab can cause hepatotoxicity with higher than expected frequencies of Grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider more frequent monitoring of liver enzymes as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes, interrupt or permanently discontinue INLYTA and avelumab or pembrolizumab, and administer corticosteroids as needed [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) ] . With the combination of INLYTA and avelumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT and increased AST were reported in 9% and 7% of patients, respectively. In patients with ALT \u22653 times ULN (Grades 2\u20134, n=82), ALT resolved to Grades 0\u20131 in 92%. Among the 73 patients who were rechallenged with either avelumab (n=3) or axitinib (n=25) administered as a single agent or with both (n=45), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in no patient receiving avelumab, 6 patients receiving INLYTA, and 15 patients receiving both avelumab and INLYTA . Twenty-two (88%) patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered to Grade 0\u20131 from the event. Immune-mediated hepatitis was reported in 7% of patients including 4.9% with Grade 3 or 4 immune-mediated hepatitis. Hepatotoxicity led to permanent discontinuation in 7% and immune-mediated hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of either avelumab or INLYTA in 5% of patients. Thirty-four patients were treated with corticosteroids and one patient was treated with a non-steroidal immunosuppressant. Resolution of hepatitis occurred in 31 of the 35 patients at the time of data cut-off. With the combination of INLYTA and pembrolizumab, Grades 3 and 4 increased ALT (20%) and increased AST (13%) were seen. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT \u22653 times ULN (Grades 2\u20134, n=116), ALT resolved to Grades 0\u20131 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either pembrolizumab (n=3) or INLYTA (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55), recurrence of ALT \u22653 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving pembrolizumab, 16 patients receiving INLYTA, and 24 patients receiving both pembrolizumab and INLYTA. All patients with a recurrence of ALT \u22653 ULN subsequently recovered from the event. 5.12 Use in Patients with Hepatic Impairment The systemic exposure to axitinib was higher in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) compared to subjects with normal hepatic function. A dose decrease is recommended when administering INLYTA to patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). INLYTA has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) , and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 5.13 Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) INLYTA in combination with avelumab can cause severe and fatal cardiovascular events. Consider baseline and periodic evaluations of left ventricular ejection fraction. Monitor for signs and symptoms of cardiovascular events. Optimize management of cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, or dyslipidemia. Permanently discontinue INLYTA and avelumab for Grade 3\u20134 cardiovascular events. MACE occurred in 7% of patients with advanced RCC treated with INLYTA in combination with avelumab compared to 3.4% treated with sunitinib in a randomized trial, JAVELIN Renal 101. These events included death due to cardiac events (1.4%), Grade 3\u20134 myocardial infarction (2.8%), and Grade 3\u20134 congestive heart failure (1.8%). Median time to onset of MACE was 4.2 months (range: 2 days to 24.5 months). 5.14 Embryo-Fetal Toxicity Based on its mechanism of action and findings from animal studies, INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available human data to inform the drug-associated risk. In developmental toxicity studies in mice, axitinib was teratogenic, embryotoxic and fetotoxic at maternal exposures that were lower than human exposures at the recommended clinical dose. Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to the fetus and to use effective contraception during treatment with INLYTA and for 1 week after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with INLYTA and for 1 week after the last dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1 , 8.3) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.1) ] . When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for pregnancy and contraception information."

The safety of INLYTA has been evaluated in combination with avelumab in JAVELIN Renal 101 and pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-426 for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The data described [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] reflect exposure to INLYTA in combination with avelumab in 434 patients and pembrolizumab in 429 patients [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The safety of INLYTA has been evaluated in 715 patients in second-line monotherapy studies, which included 537 patients with advanced RCC. The data described [see Adverse Reactions (6.1) ] reflect exposure to INLYTA in 359 patients with advanced RCC who participated in a randomized clinical study versus sorafenib [see Clinical Studies (14.2) ] . First-Line Advanced RCC INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab The safety of INLYTA in combination with avelumab was evaluated in JAVELIN Renal 101. Patients with autoimmune disease other than type I diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, psoriasis, or thyroid disorders not requiring immunosuppressive treatment were excluded. Patients received INLYTA 5 mg twice daily (N=434) in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks administered or sunitinib 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off (N=439). In the INLYTA plus avelumab arm, 70% were exposed to avelumab for \u22656 months and 29% were exposed for \u22651 year in JAVELIN Renal 101 [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The median age of patients treated with INLYTA in combination with avelumab was 62 years (range: 29 to 83), 38% of patients were 65 years or older, 71% were male, 75% were White, and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score was 0 (64%) or 1 (36%). Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 1.8% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab. These included sudden cardiac death (1.2%), stroke (0.2%), myocarditis (0.2%), and necrotizing pancreatitis (0.2%). Serious adverse reactions occurred in 35% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab. Serious adverse reactions in \u22651% of patients included diarrhea (2.5%), dyspnea (1.8%), hepatotoxicity (1.8%), venous thromboembolic disease (1.6%), acute kidney injury (1.4%), and pneumonia (1.2%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction of either INLYTA or avelumab occurred in 22% of patients: 19% avelumab only, 13% INLYTA only, and 8% both drugs. The most common adverse reactions (>1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of avelumab or the combination were hepatotoxicity (6%) and infusion-related reaction (1.8%). Dose interruptions or reductions due to an adverse reaction, excluding temporary interruptions of avelumab infusions due to infusion-related reactions, occurred in 76% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab. This includes interruption of avelumab in 50% of patients. INLYTA was interrupted in 66% and dose reduced in 19% of patients. The most common adverse reaction (>10%) resulting in interruption of avelumab was diarrhea (10%). The most common adverse reactions resulting in either interruption or dose reduction of INLYTA were diarrhea (19%), hypertension (18%), palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (18%), and hepatotoxicity (10%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in patients receiving INLYTA in combination with avelumab were diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, mucositis, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, dysphonia, decreased appetite, hypothyroidism, rash, hepatotoxicity, cough, dyspnea, abdominal pain, and headache. Forty-eight (11%) of patients treated with INLYTA in combination with avelumab received an oral prednisone dose equivalent to \u226540 mg daily for an immune-mediated adverse reaction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.12) ] . Table 4 summarizes adverse reactions that occurred in \u226520% of INLYTA in combination with avelumab-treated patients. Table 4: Adverse Reactions (\u226520%) of Patients Receiving INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab (JAVELIN Renal 101 Trial) The trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between avelumab in combination with INLYTA and sunitinib.

Patients received pre-medication with an anti-histamine and acetaminophen prior to each infusion. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 12% (Grade 3: 1.6%; no Grade 4) of patients treated with INLYTA in combination with avelumab. Table 5 summarizes selected laboratory abnormalities that occurred in \u226520% of INLYTA in combination with avelumab-treated patients. Table 5: Selected Laboratory Abnormalities Worsening from Baseline Occurring in \u226520% of Patients Receiving INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab (JAVELIN Renal 101 Trial) The trial was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in the incidence of laboratory abnormalities between INLYTA in combination with avelumab and sunitinib. Laboratory Abnormality INLYTA plus Avelumab Sunitinib Each test incidence is based on the number of patients who had both baseline and at least one on-study laboratory measurement available: INLYTA in combination with avelumab group (range: 413 to 428 patients) and sunitinib group (range: 405 to 433 patients).

Patients with medical conditions that required systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications or had a history of severe autoimmune disease other than type 1 diabetes, vitiligo, Sjogren's syndrome, and hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement were ineligible. Patients received INLYTA 5 mg orally twice daily and pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks, or sunitinib 50 mg once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks. The median duration of exposure to the combination therapy of INLYTA and pembrolizumab was 10.4 months (range: 1 day to 21.2 months). The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 30 to 89), 40% age 65 or older; 71% male; 80% White; and 80% Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of 90\u2013100 and 20% KPS of 70\u201380. Fatal adverse reactions occurred in 3.3% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab. These included 3 cases of cardiac arrest, 2 cases of pulmonary embolism and 1 case each of cardiac failure, death due to unknown cause, myasthenia gravis, myocarditis, Fournier's gangrene, plasma cell myeloma, pleural effusion, pneumonitis, and respiratory failure. Serious adverse reactions occurred in 40% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab. Serious adverse reactions in \u22651% of patients receiving INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab included hepatotoxicity (7%), diarrhea (4.2%), acute kidney injury (2.3%), dehydration (1%), and pneumonitis (1%). Permanent discontinuation due to an adverse reaction of either INLYTA or pembrolizumab occurred in 31% of patients; 13% pembrolizumab only, 13% INLYTA only, and 8% both drugs. The most common adverse reaction (>1%) resulting in permanent discontinuation of INLYTA, pembrolizumab, or the combination was hepatotoxicity (13%), diarrhea/colitis (1.9%), acute kidney injury (1.6%), and cerebrovascular accident (1.2%). Dose interruptions or reductions due to an adverse reaction, excluding temporary interruptions of pembrolizumab infusions due to infusion-related reactions, occurred in 76% of patients receiving pembrolizumab in combination with INLYTA. This includes interruption of pembrolizumab in 50% of patients. INLYTA was interrupted in 64% of patients and dose reduced in 22% of patients. The most common adverse reactions (>10%) resulting in either interruption or reduction of INLYTA were hepatotoxicity (21%), diarrhea (19%), and hypertension (18%) and the most common adverse reactions (>10%) resulting in interruption of pembrolizumab were hepatotoxicity (14%) and diarrhea (11%). The most common adverse reactions (\u226520%) in patients receiving INLYTA and pembrolizumab were diarrhea, fatigue/asthenia, hypertension, hepatotoxicity, hypothyroidism, decreased appetite, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, nausea, stomatitis/mucosal inflammation, dysphonia, rash, cough, and constipation. Twenty-seven percent (27%) of patients treated with INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab received an oral prednisone dose equivalent to \u226540 mg daily for an immune-mediated adverse reaction. Tables 6 and 7 summarize the adverse reactions and laboratory abnormalities, respectively, that occurred in at least 20% of patients treated with INLYTA and pembrolizumab in KEYNOTE-426.

      "8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS Lactation: Advise not to breastfeed. ( 8.2 ) 8.1 Pregnancy Risk Summary Based on findings in animal studies and its mechanism of action, INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no available human data to inform the drug-associated risk. In developmental toxicity studies, axitinib was teratogenic, embryotoxic and fetotoxic in mice at exposures lower than human exposures at the recommended starting dose (see Data ) . Advise females of reproductive potential of the potential risk to a fetus. The background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated populations are unknown. However, the background risk in the United States (U.S.) general population of major birth defects is 2%\u20134% and of miscarriage is 15%\u201320% of clinically recognized pregnancies. When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for pregnancy information. Data Animal Data Oral axitinib administered twice daily to female mice prior to mating and through the first week of pregnancy caused an increase in post-implantation loss at all doses tested (\u226515 mg/kg/dose, approximately 10 times the systemic exposure (AUC) in patients at the recommended starting dose). In an embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study, pregnant mice received oral doses of 0.15, 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg/dose axitinib twice daily during the period of organogenesis. Embryo-fetal toxicities observed in the absence of maternal toxicity included malformation (cleft palate) at 1.5 mg/kg/dose (approximately 0.5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose) and variation in skeletal ossification at \u22650.5 mg/kg/dose (approximately 0.15 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose). 8.2 Lactation Risk Summary There are no data on the presence of axitinib in human milk, or its effects on the breastfed child or on milk production. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in a breastfed child from INLYTA, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment and for 2 weeks after the last dose. When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for lactation information. 8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential Based on findings in animal studies, INLYTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1) ]. When INLYTA is used in combination with avelumab or pembrolizumab, refer to the full prescribing information of avelumab or pembrolizumab for contraception information. Pregnancy Testing Verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to initiating treatment with INLYTA. Contraception Females Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with INLYTA and for 1 week after the last dose. Males Based on findings in animal studies, advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 1 week after the last dose. Infertility Females and Males Based on findings in animals, INLYTA may impair fertility in females and males of reproductive potential [see Nonclinical Toxicology (13.1) ] . 8.4 Pediatric Use The safety and effectiveness of INLYTA in pediatric patients have not been established. The safety and effectiveness of INLYTA were assessed, but not established, in two open label studies: a dose finding study of INLYTA as a single agent in 17 pediatric patients aged 5 to <17 years with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (ADVL1315, NCT02164838) and a randomized study of INLYTA as a single agent or in combination in 7 pediatric patients aged 7 to <17 years (AREN1721, NCT03595124). No new safety signals were observed with INLYTA in pediatric patients across these studies. Exposure in pediatric patients who received INLYTA at the maximum tolerated dosage were lower than those previously observed in adults who received the approved recommended starting dosage. Juvenile Animal Toxicity Data Toxicities in bone and teeth were observed in immature mice and dogs administered oral axitinib twice daily for 1 month or longer. Effects in bone consisted of thickened growth plates in mice and dogs at \u226515 mg/kg/dose (approximately 6 and 15 times, respectively, the systemic exposure (AUC) in patients at the recommended starting dose). Abnormalities in growing incisor teeth (including dental caries, malocclusions and broken and/or missing teeth) were observed in mice administered oral axitinib twice daily at \u22655 mg/kg/dose (approximately 1.5 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose). Other toxicities of potential concern to pediatric patients have not been evaluated in juvenile animals. 8.5 Geriatric Use In a controlled clinical study with INLYTA for the treatment of patients with RCC, 123/359 patients (34%) treated with INLYTA were \u226565 years of age. Although greater sensitivity in some older individuals cannot be ruled out, no overall differences were observed in the safety and effectiveness of INLYTA between patients who were \u226565 years of age and younger. Of the 434 patients randomized to INLYTA 5 mg twice daily administered in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg in the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial, 38% were 65 years or older and 8% were 75 years or older. No overall difference in safety or efficacy was reported between patients who were \u226565 years of age and younger. Of the 432 patients randomized to INLYTA 5 mg twice daily administered in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg in the KEYNOTE-426 trial, 40% were 65 years or older. No overall difference in safety or efficacy was reported between patients who were \u226565 years of age and younger. No dosage adjustment is required in elderly patients [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . 8.6 Hepatic Impairment In a dedicated hepatic impairment trial, compared to subjects with normal hepatic function, systemic exposure following a single dose of INLYTA was similar in subjects with baseline mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A) and higher in subjects with baseline moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B). No starting dose adjustment is required when administering INLYTA to patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A). A starting dose decrease is recommended when administering INLYTA to patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class B) [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . INLYTA has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C). 8.7 Renal Impairment No dedicated renal impairment trial for axitinib has been conducted. Based on the population pharmacokinetic analyses, no significant difference in axitinib clearance was observed in patients with pre-existing mild to severe renal impairment (15 mL/min \u2264creatinine clearance [CLcr] <89 mL/min) [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3) ] . No starting dose adjustment is needed for patients with pre-existing mild to severe renal impairment. Caution should be used in patients with end-stage renal disease (CLcr <15 mL/min)."

      "12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 12.1 Mechanism of Action Axitinib has been shown to inhibit receptor tyrosine kinases including vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR)-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. These receptors are implicated in pathologic angiogenesis, tumor growth, and cancer progression. VEGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation and survival were inhibited by axitinib in vitro and in mouse models. Axitinib was shown to inhibit tumor growth and phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 in tumor xenograft mouse models. 12.2 Pharmacodynamics The effect of a single oral dose of INLYTA (5 mg) in the absence and presence of 400 mg ketoconazole on the QTc interval was evaluated in a randomized, single-blinded, two-way crossover study in 35 healthy subjects. No large changes in mean QTc interval (i.e., >20 ms) from placebo were detected up to 3 hours post-dose. However, small increases in mean QTc interval (i.e., <10 ms) cannot be ruled out. 12.3 Pharmacokinetics The population pharmacokinetic analysis pooled data from 17 trials in healthy subjects and patients with cancer. A two-compartment disposition model with first-order absorption and lag-time adequately describes the axitinib concentration-time profile. Absorption and Distribution Following single oral 5-mg dose administration, the median Tmax ranged from 2.5 to 4.1 hours. Based on the plasma half-life, steady state is expected within 2 to 3 days of dosing. Dosing of axitinib at 5 mg twice daily resulted in approximately 1.4-fold accumulation compared to administration of a single dose. At steady state, axitinib exhibits approximately linear pharmacokinetics within the 1-mg to 20-mg dose range. The mean absolute bioavailability of axitinib after an oral 5 mg dose is 58%. Compared to overnight fasting, administration of INLYTA with a moderate fat meal resulted in 10% lower AUC and a high fat, high-calorie meal resulted in 19% higher AUC. INLYTA can be administered with or without food [see Dosage and Administration (2.1) ] . Axitinib is highly bound (>99%) to human plasma proteins with preferential binding to albumin and moderate binding to \u03b11-acid glycoprotein. In patients with advanced RCC (n=20), at the 5 mg twice daily dose in the fed state, the geometric mean (CV%) C max and AUC 0\u201324 were 27.8 (79%) ng/mL and 265 (77%) ng.h/mL, respectively. The geometric mean (CV%) clearance and apparent volume of distribution were 38 (80%) L/h and 160 (105%) L, respectively. Metabolism and Elimination The plasma half-life of INLYTA ranges from 2.5 to 6.1 hours. Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1. Following oral administration of a 5-mg radioactive dose of axitinib, approximately 41% of the radioactivity was recovered in feces and approximately 23% was recovered in urine. Unchanged axitinib, accounting for 12% of the dose, was the major component identified in feces. Unchanged axitinib was not detected in urine; the carboxylic acid and sulfoxide metabolites accounted for the majority of radioactivity in urine. In plasma, the N-glucuronide metabolite represented the predominant radioactive component (50% of circulating radioactivity) and unchanged axitinib and the sulfoxide metabolite each accounted for approximately 20% of the circulating radioactivity. The sulfoxide and N-glucuronide metabolites show approximately \u2265400-fold less in vitro potency against VEGFR-2 compared to axitinib. Drug-Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on INLYTA Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4/5. Additionally, the aqueous solubility of axitinib is pH dependent, with higher pH resulting in lower solubility. The effects of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer, and an antacid on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib are presented in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Figure 1. Impact of Co-administered Drugs and Hepatic Impairment on Axitinib Pharmacokinetics Figure 1 Effects of INLYTA on Other Drugs In vitro studies demonstrated that axitinib has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. However, co-administration of axitinib with paclitaxel, a CYP2C8 substrate, did not increase plasma concentrations of paclitaxel in patients. In vitro studies indicated that axitinib does not inhibit CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, or UGT1A1 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. In vitro studies in human hepatocytes indicated that axitinib does not induce CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP3A4/5. Axitinib is an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro. However, INLYTA is not expected to inhibit P-gp at therapeutic plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib are presented in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Population pharmacokinetic analysis (based on pre-existing renal function) was carried out in 590 healthy volunteers and patients, including five with severe renal impairment (15 mL/min \u2264CLcr <29 mL/min), 64 with moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min \u2264CLcr <59 mL/min), and 139 with mild renal impairment (60 mL/min \u2264CLcr <89 mL/min). Mild to severe renal impairment did not have meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib. Data from only one patient with end-stage renal disease are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Other Intrinsic Factors Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body weight, body surface area, UGT1A1 genotype, or CYP2C19 genotype on the clearance of axitinib. INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab When INLYTA 5 mg was administered in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg, the respective exposures of INLYTA and avelumab were comparable to the single agents. There was no evidence to suggest a clinically relevant change of avelumab clearance over time in patients with advanced RCC. INLYTA in Combination with Pembrolizumab When INLYTA 5 mg was administered in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg, the respective exposures of INLYTA and pembrolizumab were comparable to the single agents."

In patients with advanced RCC (n=20), at the 5 mg twice daily dose in the fed state, the geometric mean (CV%) C max and AUC 0\u201324 were 27.8 (79%) ng/mL and 265 (77%) ng.h/mL, respectively. The geometric mean (CV%) clearance and apparent volume of distribution were 38 (80%) L/h and 160 (105%) L, respectively. Metabolism and Elimination The plasma half-life of INLYTA ranges from 2.5 to 6.1 hours. Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4/5 and to a lesser extent by CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and UGT1A1. Following oral administration of a 5-mg radioactive dose of axitinib, approximately 41% of the radioactivity was recovered in feces and approximately 23% was recovered in urine. Unchanged axitinib, accounting for 12% of the dose, was the major component identified in feces. Unchanged axitinib was not detected in urine; the carboxylic acid and sulfoxide metabolites accounted for the majority of radioactivity in urine. In plasma, the N-glucuronide metabolite represented the predominant radioactive component (50% of circulating radioactivity) and unchanged axitinib and the sulfoxide metabolite each accounted for approximately 20% of the circulating radioactivity. The sulfoxide and N-glucuronide metabolites show approximately \u2265400-fold less in vitro potency against VEGFR-2 compared to axitinib. Drug-Drug Interactions Effects of Other Drugs on INLYTA Axitinib is metabolized primarily in the liver by CYP3A4/5. Additionally, the aqueous solubility of axitinib is pH dependent, with higher pH resulting in lower solubility. The effects of a strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitor, a strong CYP3A4/5 inducer, and an antacid on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib are presented in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) and Drug Interactions (7.1 , 7.2) ] . Figure 1. Impact of Co-administered Drugs and Hepatic Impairment on Axitinib Pharmacokinetics Figure 1 Effects of INLYTA on Other Drugs In vitro studies demonstrated that axitinib has the potential to inhibit CYP1A2 and CYP2C8. However, co-administration of axitinib with paclitaxel, a CYP2C8 substrate, did not increase plasma concentrations of paclitaxel in patients. In vitro studies indicated that axitinib does not inhibit CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4/5, or UGT1A1 at therapeutic plasma concentrations. In vitro studies in human hepatocytes indicated that axitinib does not induce CYP1A1, CYP1A2, or CYP3A4/5. Axitinib is an inhibitor of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro. However, INLYTA is not expected to inhibit P-gp at therapeutic plasma concentrations. Specific Populations Patients with Hepatic Impairment The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib are presented in Figure 1 [see Dosage and Administration (2.2) , Warnings and Precautions (5.12) , Use in Specific Populations (8.6) ] . Patients with Renal Impairment Population pharmacokinetic analysis (based on pre-existing renal function) was carried out in 590 healthy volunteers and patients, including five with severe renal impairment (15 mL/min \u2264CLcr <29 mL/min), 64 with moderate renal impairment (30 mL/min \u2264CLcr <59 mL/min), and 139 with mild renal impairment (60 mL/min \u2264CLcr <89 mL/min). Mild to severe renal impairment did not have meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of axitinib. Data from only one patient with end-stage renal disease are available [see Use in Specific Populations (8.7) ] . Other Intrinsic Factors Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that there are no clinically relevant effects of age, gender, race, body weight, body surface area, UGT1A1 genotype, or CYP2C19 genotype on the clearance of axitinib. INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab When INLYTA 5 mg was administered in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg, the respective exposures of INLYTA and avelumab were comparable to the single agents. There was no evidence to suggest a clinically relevant change of avelumab clearance over time in patients with advanced RCC. INLYTA in Combination with Pembrolizumab When INLYTA 5 mg was administered in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg, the respective exposures of INLYTA and pembrolizumab were comparable to the single agents."

      "13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with axitinib. Axitinib was not mutagenic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation (Ames) assay and was not clastogenic in the in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration assay. Axitinib was genotoxic in the in vivo mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay. INLYTA has the potential to impair reproductive function and fertility in humans. In repeat-dose toxicology studies, findings in the male reproductive tract were observed in the testes/epididymis (decreased organ weight, atrophy or degeneration, decreased numbers of germinal cells, hypospermia or abnormal sperm forms, reduced sperm density and count) at \u226515 mg/kg/dose administered orally twice daily in mice (approximately 7 times the systemic exposure (AUC) in patients at the recommended starting dose) and \u22651.5 mg/kg/dose administered orally twice daily in dogs (approximately 0.1 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose). Findings in the female reproductive tract in mice and dogs included signs of delayed sexual maturity, reduced or absent corpora lutea, decreased uterine weights and uterine atrophy at \u22655 mg/kg/dose (approximately 1.5 or 0.3 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose compared to mice and dogs, respectively). In a fertility study in mice, axitinib did not affect mating or fertility rate when administered orally twice daily to males at any dose tested up to 50 mg/kg/dose following at least 70 days of administration (approximately 57 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose). In female mice, reduced fertility and embryonic viability were observed at all doses tested (\u226515 mg/kg/dose administered orally twice daily) following at least 15 days of treatment with axitinib (approximately 10 times the AUC in patients at the recommended starting dose)."

      "14 CLINICAL STUDIES 14.1 First-Line Advanced RCC INLYTA in Combination with Avelumab The efficacy and safety of INLYTA in combination with avelumab was demonstrated in the JAVELIN Renal 101 trial (NCT02684006), a randomized, multicenter, open-label, study of INLYTA in combination with avelumab in 886 patients with untreated advanced RCC regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression [intent-to-treat (ITT) population]. Patients with autoimmune disease or conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded. Randomization was stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) (0 vs. 1) and region (United States vs. Canada/Western Europe vs. the rest of the world). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: \u2022 INLYTA 5 mg twice daily orally was given in combination with avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks (N=442). Patients who tolerated INLYTA 5 mg twice daily without Grade 2 or greater INLYTA-related adverse events for 2 consecutive weeks could increase to 7 mg and then subsequently to 10 mg twice daily. INLYTA could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity. \u2022 Sunitinib 50 mg once daily orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off (N=444) until radiographic or clinical progression or unacceptable toxicity. Treatment with INLYTA and avelumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) assessment or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of INLYTA and avelumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline, after randomization at 6 weeks, then every 6 weeks thereafter up to 18 months after randomization, and every 12 weeks thereafter until documented confirmed disease progression by BICR. Baseline characteristics were a median age of 61 years (range: 27 to 88), 38% of patients were 65 years or older, 75% were male, 75% were White, and the ECOG PS was 0 (63%) or 1 (37%), respectively. Patient distribution by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database (IMDC) risk groups was 21% favorable, 62% intermediate, and 16% poor. The major efficacy outcome measures were progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by an BICR using RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS) in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors using a clinical trial assay (PD-L1 expression level \u22651%). Since PFS was statistically significant in patients with PD-L1-positive tumors [HR 0.61 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.79)], it was then tested in the ITT population and a statistically significant improvement in PFS in the ITT population was also demonstrated. With a median overall survival follow-up of 19 months, overall survival data were immature with 27% deaths in the ITT population. Efficacy results are presented in Table 10 and Figure 2.

K-M Estimates for PFS Based on BICR Assessment - ITT Figure 2 INLYTA in Combination with Pembrolizumab The efficacy of INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab was investigated in KEYNOTE-426 (NCT02853331), a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial conducted in 861 patients who had not received systemic therapy for advanced RCC. Patients were enrolled regardless of PD-L1 tumor expression status. Patients with active autoimmune disease requiring systemic immunosuppression within the last 2 years were ineligible. Randomization was stratified by International Metastatic RCC Database Consortium (IMDC) risk categories (favorable versus intermediate versus poor) and geographic region (North America versus Western Europe versus \"Rest of the World\"). Patients were randomized (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: \u2022 INLYTA 5 mg orally, twice daily in combination with pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks up to 24 months. Patients who tolerated INLYTA 5 mg twice daily for 2 consecutive cycles (6 weeks) could increase to 7 mg and then subsequently to 10 mg twice daily. INLYTA could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity. \u2022 Sunitinib 50 mg orally, once daily for 4 weeks and then off treatment for 2 weeks. Treatment with INLYTA and pembrolizumab continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of INLYTA and pembrolizumab was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression if the patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. Assessment of tumor status was performed at baseline, after randomization at Week 12, then every 6 weeks thereafter until Week 54, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. The study population characteristics were: median age of 62 years (range: 26 to 90); 38% age 65 or older; 73% male; 79% White and 16% Asian; 20% and 80% of patients had a baseline KPS of 70 to 80 and 90 to 100, respectively; and patient distribution by IMDC risk categories was 31% favorable, 56% intermediate and 13% poor. The main efficacy outcome measures were OS and PFS as assessed by BICR according to RECIST v1.1, modified to follow a maximum of 10 target lesions and a maximum of 5 target lesions per organ. Additional efficacy outcome measures included ORR, as assessed by BICR. A statistically significant improvement in OS was demonstrated at the first pre-specified interim analysis in patients randomized to INLYTA in combination with pembrolizumab compared with sunitinib. The trial also demonstrated statistically significant improvements in PFS and ORR. An updated OS analysis was conducted when 418 deaths were observed based on the planned number of deaths for the pre-specified final analysis.

Figure 3 14.2 Second-Line Advanced RCC The safety and efficacy of INLYTA were evaluated in a randomized, open-label, multicenter Phase 3 study. Patients (N=723) with advanced RCC whose disease had progressed on or after treatment with 1 prior systemic therapy, including sunitinib-, bevacizumab-, temsirolimus-, or cytokine-containing regimens were randomized (1:1) to receive INLYTA (N=361) or sorafenib (N=362). Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by a blinded independent central review committee. Other endpoints included objective response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS). Of the patients enrolled in this study, 389 patients (54%) had received 1 prior sunitinib-based therapy, 251 patients (35%) had received 1 prior cytokine-based therapy (interleukin-2 or interferon-alfa), 59 patients (8%) had received 1 prior bevacizumab-based therapy, and 24 patients (3%) had received 1 prior temsirolimus-based therapy. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were similar between the INLYTA and sorafenib groups with regard to age (median 61 years), gender (72% male), race (75% white, 21% Asian), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (55% 0, 45% 1), and histology (99% clear cell). There was a statistically significant advantage for INLYTA over sorafenib for the endpoint of PFS (see Table 12 and Figure 4 ). There was no statistically significant difference between the arms in OS.
